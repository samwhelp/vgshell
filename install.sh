# A release lands in ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/vgshell/X.Y.Z. The link
# vgshell/current names it and is replaced by rename alone, and ~/.local/bin/vgshell
# links to vgshell/current/bin/vgshell: the curl layout `vgshell self status` detects
# and `vgshell self update` keeps (docs/architecture/distribution.md
# § Installation ownership). --git clones main into vgshell/git and links ~/.local/bin/vgshell to
# it. Every write under vgshell/ holds flock on vgshell/.self.lock.
#
# Before it writes anything it refuses root, a system other than Linux, an
# installed system package (/usr/bin/vgshell, or vgshell or vgshell-git in the pacman
# or rpm database) and a ~/.local/bin/vgshell it did not make; --force
# skips the last two. It checks the floor: Quickshell 0.3.1, Hyprland 0.56,
# node 18, python3, git, flock and setpriv, plus xdg-terminal-exec when
# the caller has no terminal, and
# curl, tar, gzip and
# sha256sum for a release. Each version probe runs under a private runtime
# directory, so a shell with no login session reads the true floor. On a
# miss it names each tool and the command that installs it on this
# distribution, and exits 78.
# A tool it finds but whose version it cannot read is named with the
# probe's exit status and last error lines instead of an install command.
# Required runtime packages install through the staged tree's existing
# presenter and package runner before the tree is published.
#
# A release is read from the GitHub API and downloaded over HTTPS into a
# temporary directory. The archive must match its one line in SHA256SUMS;
# SHA256SUMS must carry a good signature from the release key when the
# release has SHA256SUMS.asc and gpg holds that key. Only a verified archive
# reaches vgshell/: it is unpacked in a staging directory there, installed by
# its own packaging/install-system.sh and moved into place. A failure leaves
# vgshell/current and ~/.local/bin/vgshell as they were. No version directory is
# removed here; `vgshell self update` prunes them.
#
# --uninstall removes the version directories, vgshell/current, vgshell/git and the
# link, and keeps ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/vgshell,
# ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/vgshell and vgshell/.self.lock. It refuses while
# the running shell was started from a tree it would remove, and, unless
# --force, a vgshell/git holding changes, a stash or commits no remote branch
# has.
#
# It never starts the shell, writes a service unit or edits hyprland.lua. It
# prints the line that starts VGS with Hyprland in the background.
#
# Every refusal is one line on stderr, `install.sh: refused: <key>=<value>`,
# then English. Exit 1 for a refusal, 2 for a bad argument, 75 while another
# writer holds vgshell/.self.lock, 78 below the floor.
#
# The whole script is one brace group: main's definition, then its call
# with the script's arguments. A download cut short ends inside the group,
# which bash reads as a syntax error, so it runs none of it; not even a cut
# after the word `main` runs main without its arguments.
