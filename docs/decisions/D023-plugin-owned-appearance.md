# D023: A plugin may own its look, taking only the theme's mode, accent, motion scale, interface font and raised surface

**Decision**: A plugin that names an `appearance` library in its manifest owns its look through its own token table, judged by the shell's judge, and takes only the theme's mode, accent, motion scale, resolved interface font family (`font.family.sans`, the user's Fonts choice over the theme's) and raised surface colour (`color.surfaceRaised`) as inputs. A family the look holds at that path, or a family token that reads it, draws in the user's interface font. A look that holds no token at an input's path takes nothing from that input. The glass look, VGlass, is one shared core style: `GlassSurface` of `qs.Ui` over `Theme.glass`, which takes the same five inputs and draws its default fill in the raised surface colour. A plugin opts into it and hands it only its own fill, rounding and elevation. The glass is the one place such a look meets shared tokens: with glass on it draws `Theme.glass`, which takes only those five inputs; with glass off it draws the shell's standard surface, as every surface without glass does. A signature treatment, such as an edge light or a toast's spin to a circle, stays with its plugin and shows only while the glass is on.

**Why**: Naming the theme values the design wants as the only inputs makes a leak of any other theme value unrepresentable; the motion scale is the reduced-motion control and the interface font is the user's reading choice, not styling. The raised surface is the fill the theme's own controls stand on, so a glass card and the theme's buttons on it share one hue. One judge over a second table keeps every value typed and checked. `scripts/check-design-tokens.py` refuses a literal and an unknown look.

**Rejected**: A literal allowance, a plugin-id exemption or values moved into settings, each hiding the look from the judge; and a mode inferred from background luminance, which every plugin would infer differently.

**Revisit when**: A plugin needs a sixth theme input, a look beside the glass is shared by such plugins, or a theme must restyle such a plugin after all.
