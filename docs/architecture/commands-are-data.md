# Commands are data, and they run where the user sees them

Read before touching the `tui` capability, a manifest's `tui` or `systemSteps` key, `bin/vgshell-tui`, `shell/Core/PackageManagers.js`, `vgshell pkg`, `bin/vgshell-system`, `vgshell sudo grant`, a udev rule VGS ships, the Dev Tools catalog, the requirement notice's install, or any place a plugin's or a user's text could become a command or a flow could ask the user a question or a password.

## The approach

Text a plugin, a catalog or a user supplies never becomes shell code, and anything that asks the user or needs root runs in a terminal the user sees. A plugin declares its scripts as data in its manifest's `tui` key and opens them by name through `shell.tui`; the Dev Tools catalog stores argument arrays. `shell/Core/PluginLogic.js` makes every decision about what a plugin may open. One launcher, `bin/vgshell-tui`, runs the command as an argv list in a floating terminal that outlives the shell, and the core learns that a run ended by blocking on the run's own lock ([D043](../decisions/D043-tui-run-ends-by-lock-release.md)). Every install, remove, upgrade and update check reads the one table in `shell/Core/PackageManagers.js`, and a package change runs only through `vgshell pkg run` in that terminal. Every privileged one-time setup is one row of the closed table in `bin/vgshell-system`: a plugin names a row in its manifest's `systemSteps` and never supplies a root command. The shell process never elevates. The choices are [D033](../decisions/D033-floating-tuis-are-core.md), [D034](../decisions/D034-one-package-manager-table.md), [D081](../decisions/D081-system-steps-closed-core-table.md) and [D103](../decisions/D103-passwordless-sudo-timed-or-indefinite.md).

## Why

A string that reaches a shell becomes code, and a plugin's or a catalog's text would then run outside the shell with the user's privileges. Reading the same data from a judged manifest keeps a launcher able to list other plugins' tools without naming those plugins ([D005](../decisions/D005-kinds-are-surfaces-no-dependencies.md)). A password typed into the shell process would be a secret in a QML field, a log or IPC, and a shell process that elevated would hold root with no one watching; a terminal the user sees is the one place a prompt can be answered. Separate per-flow package lists disagree on argv, and a query whose exit status the table does not list cannot be read. A plugin must never hold root commands the core did not judge, and a user-writable record could steer `undo` into disabling a unit VGS never touched.

## Rules

### Commands as data

- Do declare each script under the manifest's `tui` key, in the plugin's `tui/` directory, with capability `tui`; `PluginLogic.tuiError` refuses the rest, pinned by `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js`.
- Do ship each script as a regular file with its owner's execute bit, reached through no symbolic link; `bin/vgshell-scan` follows links when it publishes a snapshot, so a link would publish whatever it points at. `bin/lib/check-manifests.js` refuses one.
- Never open a script the manifest does not declare, from anything but the published snapshot ([D014](../decisions/D014-source-revisions-are-published-snapshots.md)), or while the plugin is disabled. `scripts/test-tui-logic.js` and `scripts/smoke/rows/tui.sh` pin it.
- Do key a core TUI `core/<name>` whatever its arguments, so one plugin update runs at a time, and answer a busy key by revealing the live window, never by a second terminal. `scripts/test-tui-logic.js` pins both.
- Never let a `missing` launcher start a process; answer `launcher-missing`. `scripts/smoke/rows/tui.sh` pins it.
- Never hand a TUI command or a package step to a shell string; each is argv. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-run.sh` pin it.

### Dev Tools catalog

- Never write a shell string in the catalog; every command there is argv. `scripts/check-devtools-catalog.js` refuses one.
- Never use `sh -c`, `eval`, `python -c`, `node -e`, `env -S` or a versioned interpreter form, and never `@latest`; a bare name is the current version. `scripts/check-devtools-catalog.js` pins each.
- Do bind a catalog database port to `127.0.0.1`, use every `brand` key in `Appearance.js`, and name only `PackageManagers.js` ids in a package map. `scripts/check-devtools-catalog.js` pins each.

### Floating TUIs

- Do launch every flow that asks the user anything, a password or a y/N, through `bin/vgshell-tui`, and hand `present` everything it needs in argv. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins it.
- Do fork the terminal with `setsid -f`; Quickshell kills its children when the shell stops, and a restart during an install must not kill the install. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins it.
- Do run a plugin's script from a private copy of its whole published snapshot; a restart removes old snapshots while a script may still read its plugin's files. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins it.
- Do strip `VGSHELL_RUNNER_PID` from the terminal's environment; a single-instance terminal hands it to later windows, and `vgshell pkg run` refuses it. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins it.
- Never source `gum.env`; parse it, and one bad line exports nothing. Put the Done or Failed prompt on `/dev/tty`, not stdout. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins both.
- Do let the presenter, the only process that knows when the command ended, write the run's record whole under a hidden name and rename it; never rewrite one, a new state is a new file, and never let the command inherit the key lock or the run lock. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins each.
- Do treat the wait on the run lock as the completion guarantee; never start two waits for one run, and never poll a process. `scripts/qml-tests/tst_tui_records.qml` and `scripts/test-tui-logic.js` pin each.
- Do keep a key's last ended record across a shell restart. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` pins it.
- Do hold one sudo session per script; a nested session joins a live owner. `scripts/test-tui.sh` pins it.
- Do pick a size class from `HyprlandLayer.TUI_WINDOWS` in `shell/Core/HyprlandLayer.js`, never a geometry. `PluginLogic.tuiError` refuses another, pinned by `scripts/test-tui-logic.js`.
- Never choose the user's terminal; it floats only when its desktop entry carries `X-TerminalArgAppId`. Gap: no check pins it.

### Packages

- Never name an elevation command in a step or a picker, never refresh a pacman-family database without upgrading, and never pass `--noconfirm` or `-y`. `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-table.js` pins each.
- Do refuse `vgshell pkg run` in a process the shell started and without a terminal. The shell removes `VGSHELL_RUNNER_PID` only from the programs it opens for the user, so a plugin process never elevates and a user's own terminal is not refused. `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-run.sh` pins it.
- Do run steps and queries from `$HOME`, so a project's `mise.toml` cannot change what a check counted. `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-run.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-cli.js` pin it.
- Never add a query whose exit statuses the table does not list, and give every parser a canned output under `scripts/fixtures/pkg/`, so a parser given a changed format fails rather than miscounts. `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-table.js` pins both.
- Do run one check at a time under the lock, and end a query past its timeout with its process group. `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-cli.js` pins both.
- Do give nix no steps and no check; a NixOS system changes through its configuration.

### System steps

- Never add a root action outside the table in `bin/vgshell-system`; a manifest's `systemSteps` names table rows only, and dictation setup offers the table's `voxtype-engine` step for its engine switch. `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` and `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js` pin it.
- Do write the record, root-owned under `/var/lib/vgshell/system/`, before the commands, so a partial failure is on record, and undo only the recorded change, for the caller's uid, in the boot that made it. `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` pins both.
- Do probe real access, never a file's presence; a probe that cannot answer reads `unknown`, never `ready`. `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` pins the `unknown` state.
- Never overwrite a destination VGS did not write; refuse a symlink destination and a foreign file as `foreign`. `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` pins it.
- Do grant a device by `uaccess` alone, in a rule that sorts before `73-seat-late.rules`, which applies the tag; a `GROUP` or `MODE` grant reaches SSH and other-seat sessions. `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` pins the shipped rule.
- Never start greetd from inside a session, enable it only, and refuse the greeter step unless the install tree is root's and writable by no one else, since the greeter account runs where every password is typed ([D101](../decisions/D101-greeter-host-and-greeter-system-step.md)). `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` pins both.
- Do resolve every command of the sudo grant's root half in the system directories alone, drop the sudo credential before and after each verb that reaches it, and run the root half under `bash -p` with `PATH`, `LC_ALL` and `SUDO_UID` alone. `scripts/test-vgshell-sudo-grant.sh` pins each under `unshare -r`.
- Do publish a timed grant by rename only after its expiry timer is armed and the boot cleanup is in place, with a `NOTAFTER` rule sudo ends itself. `scripts/test-vgshell-sudo-grant.sh` pins it.
- Do write nothing and run no sudo on NixOS; print the configuration snippet instead, for the grant the `security.sudo.extraRules` snippet. `scripts/test-vgshell-sudo-grant.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` pin the `nixos` state.
- Never let a step reach the host's devices, units or sudo in the sandbox. `scripts/smoke/rows/system-steps.sh` and `scripts/smoke/rows/auth-sentinel.sh` pin it.

### Consent

- Do start every install, root change and plugin or theme change from the user's own press, and show every root command before it runs, then run only the plan shown. `scripts/test-vgshell-system.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-sudo-grant.sh` pin it.
- Do let the package manager ask for root in the floating terminal, never in the shell: the requirement notice's Install opens the core TUI `core/requirements-install`, one manager per press. `scripts/smoke/rows/notices.sh` pins the Install run, and `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-run.sh` refuses `vgshell pkg run` in a shell process. `PluginLogic.noticeRequest` decides which requirements a notice lists, and `PluginLogic.noticeAdmit` decides when an offer a plugin raises with no press rests; an offer a press raises never rests.
- Do keep the question a command asks on its terminal: a core TUI that adds, updates or removes a plugin or a theme runs without `--yes`, and the prompted theme add asks before it applies the new theme ([D007](../decisions/D007-install-runs-no-plugin-code.md)).
- Do open the requirement notice instead of a plugin's script while a command the script needs is missing. `scripts/test-tui-logic.js` pins it.

## The canonical example

`scripts/smoke/fixtures/plugins/acme.tui/` for a script, and `scripts/smoke/fixtures/plugins/acme.system/` for a root setup. Copy them.

## Revisit when

`xdg-terminal-exec` drops `--app-id`, gum changes its environment names, a TUI needs a geometry no size class covers, a supported package manager cannot be expressed as argv steps, the shell must change a package with no terminal open, a step needs a privilege a sudo command cannot give, a distribution ships these grants itself, or a Flatpak presence and launch model exists for the catalog.

## Not governed

Which commands a plugin needs and the requirement notice's queue, which are `PluginLogic.noticeRequest` and `PluginLogic.noticeAdmit`; the functions of the presentation library, which `bin/lib/tui.sh` lists in its header; the one elevation a shell process performs, the Chromium policy writer, which is [D029](../decisions/D029-chromium-policy-writer.md); the greeter host's own rules, which are [D101](../decisions/D101-greeter-host-and-greeter-system-step.md) and the `vgs.greeter` README.
