# Every channel installs one shared tree

Read before touching the licence, `VERSION`, `vgshell --version`, a package recipe, the installer, the flake, the autostart entry, `vgshell self`, `bin/lib/self.js`, a tree's `current` link, or anything else that packages, installs or updates VGS.

## The approach

Every channel runs one installer, `packaging/install-system.sh`, into one tree, packs one tarball builder, prints one first-install text, and derives its dependencies from the core and plugin declarations through one offline recipe check, `scripts/check-packaging.js`. A channel is an entry in that check's `CHANNELS` table, never a branch on its id. Every bash script under the installed `bin/` sets its own runtime `PATH`, because a process Hyprland or a single-instance terminal starts inherits no wrapper. A system package starts the shell after a first install and autostarts it through an XDG entry, and never writes a line into the user's `hyprland.lua`. The choice is [D040](../decisions/D040-one-shared-install-tree.md).

The install method decides who owns the tree, and `bin/lib/self.js` is the one judge of that method, a checkout, a package, a curl install or a Nix tree, and of whether the tree is behind. VGS updates only an installation it laid out itself: `vgshell self update` fast-forwards a checkout or replaces a curl install, and refuses a package or Nix tree, naming the step that updates it. The curl installer and the self-update write only under a directory VGS owns, under one lock, `.self.lock`, and only a verified archive reaches it; the installer starts no shell, writes no unit and edits no `hyprland.lua`.

## Why

One installer gives every channel the same file set. The tree is scripts and data, not architecture-specific binaries, so it lives under `/usr/share`. A recipe that hand-lists its dependencies drifts from the declarations the scan probes. Publishing runs from the maintainer's machine, so no signing or AUR key sits in the repository.

A package manager or Nix owns the tree it installed, and its next update would overwrite whatever VGS wrote there. A checkout fast-forwards with no diff and no question because VGS is the program the user runs, not third-party code. An AUR helper reports a `-git` package behind only when its recipe's version changes, so VGS reads `vgshell-git`'s commit itself. `Hyprland --version` aborts when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset, so the installer probes under a private empty one.

## Rules

### Channels

- Do install through `packaging/install-system.sh` with `DESTDIR` and `PREFIX`; it writes only under `DESTDIR` from a read-only source. `scripts/test-install-tree.sh` pins it.
- Do commit `packaging/install-tree.manifest` after adding a shipped file, through `scripts/check-install-tree.sh --write`; every package build and the read-only-prefix smoke row run the check.
- Do raise a `preflight_floor` in `bin/vgshell` and every recipe together, and state no runtime floor in the README; `vgshell run` checks the floor, and `scripts/check-packaging.js` refuses a recipe that differs.
- Do print `bin/lib/post-install.txt` from a scriptlet on a first install only; a scriptlet holds no text of its own. `scripts/check-packaging.js` pins it.
- Never add a required plugin command without a package on every channel or a row in `packaging/channel-gaps.json`. `scripts/check-packaging.js` pins it.
- Do mark a required command `"install": "on-request"` only when its package must stay an optional dependency of every recipe; its plugin's Requirements section installs it. `scripts/check-packaging.js` pins it.
- Never give a recipe `conflicts`, `replaces` or `provides`; the two packages own the same files. `scripts/check-packaging.js` pins it.
- Do set `SYSCONFDIR` only in a system package; it installs the browser-policy sudoers rule, the autostart entry and the Hyprland portal preference, which the flake and the curl installer must not ship. `scripts/test-install-tree.sh` pins it.
- Do name the autostart entry's `Exec` by absolute path, keep `OnlyShowIn=Hyprland;`, and never write a user entry from the installer. `scripts/test-install-tree.sh` runs the host generator.
- Do compute the Fedora `Requires` block between its markers from data, and write each floor with its package's epoch. `scripts/check-packaging.js` and `scripts/fedora-container.sh` pin them.
- Do clone `vgshell-git` in `prepare()` with a single-branch filtered clone, never a `git+` source, which mirrors every advertised ref. `scripts/check-packaging.js` pins it.
- Do insert the one `# vgs-nix-path` line after each script's leading comment block, and never put Hyprland on the runtime `PATH`. `scripts/test-flake.sh` pins both.

### Licence

- The SPDX licence expression of a VGS package is `MIT AND OFL-1.1 AND ISC AND Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-SA-4.0`.
- Do keep that expression in every recipe; `scripts/check-packaging.js` reads it from the line above and refuses a recipe that differs.

### Version

- Do read the version from `VERSION` beside `bin/`, never from a package manager; `scripts/test-vgshell-version.sh` pins it.

### Release tarball

- Do pack a commit, never the working tree, through `scripts/lib/release-tarball.sh`, the one builder of a source tarball; `scripts/test-release.sh` pins the parity.

### Installation ownership

- Do make every git call in `bin/vgshell` and hand `bin/lib/self.js` the facts; `self.js` decides. Review holds it.
- Never refuse `vgshell self` on a failed step; it becomes `error`, exit 0, and the fields read before it stay. `scripts/test-vgshell-self.sh` pins it.
- Do keep three trees after an update: the new one, the one the command ran from, and the one the running shell started from. `scripts/test-vgshell-self.sh` pins it with a control that removes the running shell's tree.
- Do fetch with no hook, no prompt, no askpass, no `FETCH_HEAD` and a timeout. `scripts/test-vgshell-outdated.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-self.sh` pin each.
- Do keep the whole installer one brace group, so a cut download runs nothing. `scripts/test-install-sh.sh` pins it.
- Do refuse root, a non-Linux host, a system package and a foreign `~/.local/bin/vgshell` before writing. `scripts/test-install-sh.sh` pins each.
- Do fetch with `curl --proto =https --tlsv1.2`, match the one `SHA256SUMS` line, replace `current` by rename only, and never remove a version directory from the installer. `scripts/test-install-sh.sh` pins each.
- Do run required installs through the staged tree's presenter and package runner, which owns elevation. `scripts/test-install-sh.sh` pins it with a fake presenter.
- Do hold the installer's floor and package tables to `bin/vgshell` and `config/requirements.json`; the drift rows of `scripts/test-install-sh.sh` pin them.
- Do accept `VGS_RELEASE_API` only in a test run: a `file://` base in the installer, a loopback base in `self.js`. `scripts/test-install-sh.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-self.sh` pin it.

## The canonical example

`packaging/arch/vgshell/PKGBUILD` for a new channel, `scripts/test-vgshell-self.sh` for a new install method or update outcome. Copy them.

## Revisit when

VGS ships architecture-specific binaries, a distribution's repositories reach the floor, the owner reinstates CI, autostart settles enough for a Home Manager module, the self-update gains the installer's signature check.

## Not governed

The release flow, which is `DEVELOPMENT.md` § Release; the README's install section, which `scripts/check-readme.js` holds.
