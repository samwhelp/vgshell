## Project Instructions

VGS delivery policy overrides the shared workflow's mandatory review, CI-wait, branch-size and commit-hook gates. Work targets main. PRs are optional; push directly or merge a PR immediately with gh, with no queue or CI wait. Review goes by risk: a change to code where a defect shows as a performance, stability, race, leak or lifetime problem (services, Quickshell or Hyprland IPC, processes and timers, file or socket watchers, object ownership and destruction, caches, concurrency, the plugin scan and publish path, the sandbox and smoke harness) runs one internal review round, the orch review panel, before the push; a change that is only layout, copy, styling, tokens, docs or a settings field runs none. The done line names which applied and why. Do not arm git guards. Run scripts/validate once on the final relevant diff; use --changed <last-validated-commit> for a fix round, and reuse passing results while those inputs are unchanged. Do not rerun a full battery at commit, push or submission. Use --full only for an explicit full sweep or an unmapped dependency. Keep the live-session safety rules.

# Preflight

Run preflight in the validate step, before the project's own validation command.

```bash
.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight              # vs the default branch's merge base
.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight --staged     # staged changes (pre-commit)
.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight --all        # every tracked file, every line
```

Fix what a finding reports; never widen a lane's exclusions to clear it.

Lanes, scopes, settings, output and exit codes are in `preflight --help`. Diff construction and the `unwired-suite`, `data-syntax`, `applied-migration-edited` and `fail-open` sourced-library glob grammars are [references/lanes.md](references/lanes.md). Hook and CI wiring is [README.md](README.md) § Wiring.
