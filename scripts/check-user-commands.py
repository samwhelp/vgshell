"""Enforce the no-manual-commands rule of D061 on the text a user reads.

A setup step is automatic or one click. The interface shows no command,
except where VGS cannot run a step on this system and the user must run it
by hand. A plugin README keeps commands behind a "Show command" details
block. This check fails where user-facing text tells the user to run a
command:
  instruction   a clause that opens with an imperative verb of VERBS and
                names a command: inline code whose first word is a command
                head, or, outside Markdown, a command head as the verb's
                object; or a clause whose subject is inline code naming a
                command, followed by a verb of SUBJECT_VERBS, as in
                "`vgshell plugin enable x` brings it back". A clause opens at
                the start of the text, after `.`, `!`, `?`, `:` or `;`,
                after a comma, and after `or` or `then`. A first word that
                is a path names the command its last part does, so
                `bin/vgshell` is `vgshell`. Outside Markdown, a command
                head the verb takes as its other object, after a comma or
                `or`, is one too, as in "Run this again, or vgshell sudo
                revoke, to end it".
  shell-block   a fenced code block of Markdown, untagged or tagged with a
                shell of SHELL_FENCES, whose first command word is a command
                head.
  code-command  a command inside a string literal of shipped QML or
                JavaScript bound to a property of DRAWN, the text a page, a
                notice, a plugin's system notification or a CodeLine draws:
                inline code whose first word is a command head, or a literal
                that opens with a head and an argument, as "vgshell plugin
                enable x" does. A command
                there is copied off a label. A log line is read by
                `instruction` alone. A binding reaches back over the lines its statement
                wraps across, so `text: ready` then `? "..."` on the next
                line is bound to `text`.
  page-reference  prose that names a VGS page, tab or section in plain words
                (PAGE_REFERENCE), as "in Settings > AI model", "under
                Requirements" or "Open Capture settings" does, in a manifest
                string or a string literal. Such words
                are a link that opens the page: the words of LinkText's
                page reference, `[words](page:<plugin id>)`, or of a
                manifest entry's `link`. A TUI line cannot link and names
                the button that opens the page instead. Markdown is not
                read for it. The references of a plugin PAGE_PENDING names
                are listed and not refused, one line each,
                `page-reference-pending <plugin> <file>:<line> <excerpt>`,
                then `check-user-commands: page-references-pending=<n>
                plugins=<ids>`; a plugin named there with none left is
                refused, so the tuple only shrinks.
  page-reference-target  a complete literal page reference whose plugin id
                names no plugin directory under the root's plugins/. A
                target completed by concatenation is not judged. With
                --plugin, the target directories are that plugin's siblings.
A string literal is a quoted one or a template literal, whose `${...}`
parts read as the argument $ARG.
The text read is every Markdown file and every manifest.json of each plugin
directory under the root's plugins/, the user-facing strings of each
manifest (FIELDS, each key the judge admits named there or in EXEMPT), and
every string literal of every `.qml` and `.js` file
under the root, comments blanked through scripts/qml_source.py, and the
text a floating TUI draws: each quoted argument a script hands a drawing
function of bin/lib/tui.sh (TUI_DRAW), read as `instruction`, in every
file of a plugin's tui/ and, beside the root, every file of bin/ that
sources lib/tui.sh. A whole-line `#` comment is not read, and neither is
other output a script prints, which its command line shares. A
`<details>` block of Markdown whose `<summary>` reads "Show command" is not
read.

A command head is a command VGS knows a user could be told to run: a file
name in bin/, a requirement `command` of any plugin manifest under the root
or the repository's shell/ and of config/requirements.json, a binary of every manager in
shell/Core/PackageManagers.js and each of its elevators. The heads are read
from those artifacts, never listed here; fewer than HEADS_FLOOR, or a set
missing a REQUIRED_HEADS member, means an extractor broke, and the run ends
unreadable rather than certifying a tree against too few heads.

Usage: check-user-commands.py [ROOT | --plugin DIR]
ROOT is the repository's shell/ by default. `--plugin DIR` reads one plugin
directory alone, as `vgs-plugin check` passes it. The pass is
`check-user-commands: ok files=<n> strings=<n> heads=<n>`. Each finding is
one line `<rule> <file>:<line> <excerpt>`. Exit 0 when clean, 1 on any
finding, 2 when a file cannot be read or the heads are incomplete, printed
as `check-user-commands: unreadable: <what>: <why>`.
