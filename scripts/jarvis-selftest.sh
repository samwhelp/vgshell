# The sandbox is the smoke's own (scripts/smoke/harness.sh), with the
# checkout's Jarvis plugin put back over the harness's instrumented copy, so
# the daemon, its engine, its speech sidecar and its audio children are the
# shipped ones and run as in a session: nothing is scripted or stood in.
# The rules this run keeps are docs/architecture/validation.md § Jarvis
# self-test.
#
# The input is one of:
#   --wav FILE   a recorded 16-bit PCM WAV, played into the sandbox PipeWire's voice
#                feed (scripts/smoke/devices.sh), whose source side is the
#                microphone Jarvis records with its own pw-record. The feed
#                starts only once the bar widget reads the microphone open
#                and a capture stream reads that source.
#   --tts TEXT   the same, over a WAV spoken from TEXT by the text-to-speech
#                voice the prepared setup's tier loads, piper or kokoro.
#   --type TEXT  the line sent through the plugin's `say` IPC handler.
# A voice input opens the conversation through the service's Talk intent in
# Toggle mode, or through the local wake word in Always mode, so the
# engine's own end-of-speech judge commits the turn. A follow-up input is
# fed only after an Always mode reply opens the listening window, and its
# record compares that second turn.
#
# --brain ID is an account id the Jarvis AI model list offers. A sign-in
# account's own directory variable is the one value of the caller's
# environment that enters the sandbox.
# Copilot also receives a filtered session bus for its native keyring read.
# The filter refuses unlocks and writes. No token enters a file or log.
# A sign-in brain uses its installed program directory first on PATH,
# resolved by mise when installed, otherwise by the caller's command lookup.
# A failed lookup ends the run before the sandbox starts.
# --model NAME sets the sandbox's model before the turn. A local server
# brain requires it: the account reader offers no local-server model list.
# --voice realtime listens and speaks through OpenAI's Realtime session with
# the caller's one saved OpenAI key, the key the plugin's Accounts page
# chooses by itself; --voice gemini does the same through Google's Gemini
# Live session with the caller's one saved Gemini key. local, the default,
# is the prepared local voice below plus the sandbox's own voxtype config.
# --voice elevenlabs hears through that same local voice and speaks the
# reply through ElevenLabs with the caller's one saved ElevenLabs key.
# A saved key, the brain's or the cloud voice's, is read under the
# owner's exception in docs/architecture/validation.md § Jarvis self-test.
# Its reference, which holds no secret, is saved in the sandbox by the
# plugin's own writer. Jarvis's own `secret-tool lookup` of it goes to the
# caller's session bus through a filter, an xdg-dbus-proxy that passes the
# calls a lookup of an unlocked key makes to org.freedesktop.secrets and
# nothing else: no other bus name and no unlock, so a locked keyring fails
# the lookup and shows no prompt. Before Jarvis starts, the run reads
# through that filter whether each key is there and unlocked.
# --home PATH copies that folder into the sandbox's HOME and names the copy
# as the Jarvis home folder; the folder itself is read twice, for its
# checksums before and after, and never written. Where the copy holds the
# kendex mail tool, the run records a Jarvis session in the copy's fleet
# state with the copy's own kendex workflow-state, so the send Jarvis makes
# with that tool lands. The run reads the copy's Jarvis session mailbox as
# the Jarvis session does, with the checkout's lane-mail: once before Jarvis
# starts, which makes the mailbox where the folder has none and marks the
# rows it holds as read, and once after the turn, for the rows the turn added.
# --mode toggle opens a voice turn through the Talk intent. --mode always
# waits for the wake-word capture to read armed and feeds a wake phrase.
# Always mode needs a voice that hears on this computer, local or
# elevenlabs, because the local sidecar spots the word. It is refused with
# --type, a voice that hears in the cloud and --cold.
# --confirm key confirms each request Jarvis shows as its Confirm key does,
# with one press a request, made once Session's draw guard has passed;
# none, the default, answers none, so a request ends on Jarvis's own bound.
# --cloned-voice turns on the local voice's Cloned voice setting. The
# prepared setup then also holds a cloned voice setup-local made beside its
# graphics card tier: the clone folder below its data root, and its
# clone-ready.json and voice-reference.wav beside its ready marker, which
# the run copies into the sandbox's state as this user's 0600 files. It
# needs the local voice and a single turn; a case asks for it with
# "clonedVoice": true.
# --suite NAME runs one case from scripts/jarvis-selftest-cases/. --suite all
# runs every case, sorted by name. --voices DIR lets a suite use DIR/<case>.wav
# for a case input, without changing tracked cases. A suite writes records
# under OUT when --out names a directory, otherwise under
# tmp/selftest-records/suite-<UTC>.
# --out FILE is the record for a single turn; the default is a new file under
# tmp/selftest-records/.
#
# The local voice and the --tts speaker run from prepared inputs: JARVIS_LOCAL_MODELS and
# JARVIS_LOCAL_PYTHON name the models and the interpreter of one setup the
# plugin's own setup-local made under a scratch HOME,
# <HOME>/.local/share/vgshell/jarvis/local/models and
# .../local/venv/bin/python, and the run reads that setup's ready marker,
# <HOME>/.local/state/vgshell/jarvis/local-ready.json. With --voice local,
# VOXTYPE_MODELS names the caller's voxtype model directory. The run writes
# the sandbox HOME's voxtype config from config/voxtype/config.toml, points
# its configured engine model at VOXTYPE_MODELS, and reads that model in
# place. voxtype 1.1.0 has no config key that selects the CPU ONNX build, so
# the run puts a voxtype wrapper in the sandbox command shim, ahead of the
# shell's PATH, and that wrapper execs the canonical CPU build directly.
#
# With --cold N, the record is one JSON object: `kind: "cold-starts"`,
# `starts` and `cpuPressure`. Each start disables and enables Jarvis and
# records each status change as {ms, lifetime, daemon, setup, cause}, then
# ends at ready, setting or problem.
#
# Otherwise the record is one JSON object: `input` {kind, value}, `brain`, `home`,
# `voice`, `mode`, `confirm`, `heard` (the text Session committed as the user turn),
# `sentences` (each sentence released to speech as {ms, text}; with a duplex
# voice, realtime or gemini, whose transcript of its own speech arrives in fragments, each
# assistant caption segment whole as {ms of its first words, text}), `raw`
# (each brain turn's text as the brain wrote it, before Jarvis chose what to
# speak, from the trace the daemon writes for a test run alone), `tools`
# (each audit record of a tool call as {tool, decision, confirmed, outcome},
# names only), `dictation` (daemon changes as {ms, daemon, child},
# recording changes as {ms, phase}, and unread, the count of failed lending
# record reads during the voice window),
# `sidecar` ({reference}: whether the running local speech sidecar was
# handed the cloned voice's recording, read from its argv, null for none),
# `mailbox` (with --home, each row the Jarvis session's read of
# its mailbox hands over after the turn, as lane-mail prints it; null
# without), `widget` (each bar widget state as {ms, state}), `phases` (each
# Session phase as {ms, phase}), `audio`
# {speechEndMs, firstMs, longestGapMs, sounds}, `end` {kind, phase, fault}
# and `passed`. A suite comparison adds `case.source`: `case` for the tracked
# input or `local` for --voices. Every ms counts from the input's start on the shell's own
# clock, using input_started_ms and now_ms; firstMs and longestGapMs are relative to speech end.
# `end.kind` is completed, fault, gate-down, no-wake or timeout; `passed`
# is true only for a completed turn with a heard text, in
# a run whose --home folder, when named, reads as before, that reached no
# authentication stand-in and failed no sandbox check.
#
# The last line is `selftest=<key>`: `selftest=<end.kind> record=<file>`
# after a turn, else the reason no turn ran. Exit 0 for a passed record, 1
# for any other record or a failed step, 2 for a refused argument, and 77
# when the run could not run, which is never a pass. In suite mode the last
