# Run one real Jarvis turn in the nested sandbox and write one record of it.

# Usage: scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh --cold N [--out FILE]
#        scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh (--wav FILE | --tts TEXT | --type TEXT)
#                                   --brain ID [--home PATH]
#                                   [--voice local|realtime]
#                                   [--confirm key|none] [--out FILE]
#
# The sandbox is the smoke's own (scripts/smoke/harness.sh), with the
# checkout's Jarvis plugin put back over the harness's instrumented copy, so
# the daemon, its engine, its speech sidecar and its audio children are the
# shipped ones and run as in a session: nothing is scripted or stood in.
# The rules this run keeps are docs/architecture/validation.md § Jarvis
# self-test.
#
# The input is one of:
#   --wav FILE   a recorded voice, played into the sandbox PipeWire's voice
#                feed (scripts/smoke/devices.sh), whose source side is the
#                microphone Jarvis records with its own pw-record. The feed
#                starts only once the bar widget reads the microphone open
#                and a capture stream reads that source.
#   --tts TEXT   the same, over a WAV the pinned voice that made the plugin's
#                probe.wav speaks from TEXT (fixtures/PROVENANCE).
#   --type TEXT  the line sent through the plugin's `say` IPC handler.
# A voice input opens the conversation through the service's Talk intent, in
# Toggle talk mode, so the engine's own end-of-speech judge commits the turn.
#
# --brain ID is an account id the Jarvis AI model list offers. A sign-in
# account's own directory variable is the one value of the caller's
# environment that enters the sandbox.
# --voice realtime listens and speaks through OpenAI's Realtime session with
# the caller's one saved OpenAI key, the key the plugin's Accounts page
# chooses by itself; local, the default, is the prepared local voice below.
# A saved key, the brain's or the realtime voice's, is read under the
# owner's exception in docs/architecture/validation.md § Jarvis self-test.
# Its reference, which holds no secret, is saved in the sandbox by the
# plugin's own writer. Jarvis's own `secret-tool lookup` of it goes to the
# caller's session bus through a filter, an xdg-dbus-proxy that passes the
# calls a lookup of an unlocked key makes to org.freedesktop.secrets and
# nothing else: no other bus name and no unlock, so a locked keyring fails
# the lookup and shows no prompt. Before Jarvis starts, the run reads
# through that filter whether each key is there and unlocked.
# --home PATH copies that folder into the sandbox's HOME and names the copy
# as the Jarvis home folder; the folder itself is read twice, for its
# checksums before and after, and never written. The run reads the copy's
# master session mailbox as the master does, with the checkout's lane-mail:
# once before Jarvis starts, which makes the mailbox where the folder has
# none and marks the rows it holds as read, and once after the turn, for
# the rows the turn added.
# --confirm key confirms each request Jarvis shows as its Confirm key does,
# with one press a request, made once Session's draw guard has passed;
# none, the default, answers none, so a request ends on Jarvis's own bound.
# --out FILE is the record; the default is a new file under
# tmp/selftest-records/.
#
# The local voice and the --tts speaker run from prepared inputs: JARVIS_LOCAL_MODELS and
# JARVIS_LOCAL_PYTHON name the models and the interpreter of one setup the
# plugin's own setup-local made under a scratch HOME,
# <HOME>/.local/share/vgshell/jarvis/local/models and
# .../local/venv/bin/python, and the run reads that setup's ready marker,
# <HOME>/.local/state/vgshell/jarvis/local-ready.json.
#
# With --cold N, the record is one JSON object: `kind: "cold-starts"`,
# `starts` and `cpuPressure`. Each start disables and enables Jarvis and
# records each status change as {ms, lifetime, daemon, setup, cause}, then
# ends at ready, setting or problem.
#
# Otherwise the record is one JSON object: `input` {kind, value}, `brain`, `home`,
# `voice`, `confirm`, `heard` (the text Session committed as the user turn),
# `sentences` (each sentence released to speech as {ms, text}; with --voice
# realtime, whose transcript of its own speech arrives in fragments, each
# assistant caption segment whole as {ms of its first words, text}), `raw`
# (each brain turn's text as the brain wrote it, before Jarvis chose what to
# speak, from the trace the daemon writes for a test run alone), `tools`
# (each audit record of a tool call as {tool, decision, confirmed, outcome},
# names only), `mailbox` (with --home, each row the master session's read of
# its mailbox hands over after the turn, as lane-mail prints it; null
# without), `widget` (each bar widget state as {ms, state}), `end`
# {kind, phase, fault} and `passed`. Every ms counts from the input's start
# on the shell's own clock. `end.kind` is completed, fault, gate-down or
# timeout; `passed` is true only for a completed turn with a heard text, in
# a run whose --home folder, when named, reads as before, that reached no
# authentication stand-in and failed no sandbox check.
#
# The last line is `selftest=<key>`: `selftest=<end.kind> record=<file>`
# after a turn, else the reason no turn ran. Exit 0 for a passed record, 1
# for any other record or a failed step, 2 for a refused argument, and 77
# when the run could not run, which is never a pass:
#   selftest=keyring-no-key            no key is stored: `key=unsaved` where
#                                      no OpenAI key is saved for the realtime
#                                      voice, `key=absent` where the keyring
#                                      holds no item for a saved one
#   selftest=keyring-locked            the keyring holds the key locked
