# The runner cases run a copy of the runner in a scratch tree, beside a
# stand-in fence that records how it was called and a stand-in harness
# that makes a scratch sandbox with an instrumented Jarvis copy and ends
# the run once its shell has started, or, where a case leaves the device
# guard's answer, at the step after the guard. The accounts are a scratch
# HOME's: one sign-in folder and the saved key references a case writes,
# whose ids the plugin's own account helper lists with no command on its
# PATH. The prepared local voice is a scratch setup of empty files.
# `pw-dump` is a stub that prints a planted graph, which the real
# devices_voice_feed_state reads.
# The keyring is a stand-in secrets service on a scratch bus this file
# starts, never the caller's: it holds one item, present, locked or absent
# as a case sets it, logs each call it gets, and owns a second bus name. The
# runner's own filter, a real xdg-dbus-proxy, and the real secret-tool and
# busctl reach it. Without one of those programs the keyring cases are not
# measured and the file exits 77 once the others have run.
# The function cases run the runner's own functions, cut from its file,
# over planted traces, audit records and folders, with the harness's own
# py_reply. The mailbox cases run the checkout's lane-mail over a row the
# plugin's own Home.js wrote, so the row Jarvis writes is one the master
# session's reader hands over.
# Each control plants one defect in a copy of the runner and requires the
# case that rule owns to go red. A defect whose text the runner no longer
# holds fails its control. The runner's call of the fence is held by
# scripts/test-gpu-fence.sh.
#
# Exit 0 when every case and control holds, 1 when one does not, and 77
# when all that ran hold and the keyring cases could not run.
