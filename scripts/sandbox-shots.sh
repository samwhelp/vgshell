# The sandbox is the smoke's own (scripts/smoke/harness.sh): its own HOME,
# runtime dir, buses and nested compositor, with the shell started inside
# it. grim is pointed at the nested compositor's socket alone
# (scripts/smoke/shot.sh refuses the host socket), so nothing is captured
# or started on the live desktop. It needs the smoke's prerequisites,
# WAYLAND_DISPLAY and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR included, plus grim.
#

# SCENE is gallery, settings, wide-settings, focus, focus-open, flyout-titles, plugin-pages, manager, launcher,
# notifications, bar, panels, devtools, system, network, vpn, bluetooth, power, dialog, by-hand, reset, lock, polkit,
# greeter, narrow, theme-browser, wallpaper-browser, automations, tooltips, capture,
# keyhints, clipboard, voice, voice-setup, jarvis-console, jarvis-setup, outdated, jarvis-causes, plugin-messages, traffic, ai-usage, sysmon, appearance, sounds or theme-previews. settings takes the
# automations', the Jarvis, the AI Usage and the Tray pages among the plugin pages,
# each when the tree ships its plugin. plugin-pages, taken only when named, opens every
# plugin the Settings window lists, in that window's order, and captures
# every screen of an overflowing page. bar is the bar with every
# first-party widget and each widget's tooltip or
# hover; tooltips, taken only when named, enables and places every
# first-party plugin with a bar widget and shoots each widget's tooltip;
# panels is the Agent Warden panel, the Updates window and the
# themes panel over planted status or packages, the themes panel's
# apply held and answered by a stand-in
# runner that changes no theme; devtools is the Dev Tools window;
# appearance is the System window's Appearance group, Motion, Windows, UI
# and, where the tree ships it, Fonts, each Set by theme, then Windows with
# a corner radius of 12; sounds,
# taken only when named, is its Sounds section over the events of
# Notifications, Voice and Jarvis, then with a picker's list open and with
# one event turned off; system
# is the System window as it opens with no System section enabled, then
# System → Displays over the device fakes and two monitors when the tree
# ships it, and
# its Sound section over the sandbox's private PipeWire, then the window
# as Sound is turned off while shown, the Mouse pane and Keyboard's pane,
# widget menu and panel source menu; bluetooth is
# its Bluetooth section, then the Bluetooth dropdown, over the device
# fakes; vpn is its VPN section, then the VPN dropdown, over the
# tailscale and nmcli stand-ins; power is its flyout over the sandbox's fake
# battery and power profile daemon; keyhints is the
# Key Hints window over the Launcher's, Settings' and Themes' shortcuts and
# its own; ai-usage is AI Usage's dropdown opened from its bar widget over
# three signed-in accounts, two Claude Code and one Codex, at rest and
# scrolled so the dividers under its header and over its footer show, read
# as scripts/smoke/rows/ai-usage.sh reads them: the endpoint stand-in
# scripts/fixtures/ai-usage/endpoint.js on 127.0.0.1, the Codex stand-in
# beside it and planted sign-ins, with no host claude or codex on the
# shell's PATH; jarvis-console is the Jarvis console window over the
# scripted daemon fixture in each conversation state, taken only when
# named; clipboard is the clipboard history over copies made on the
# nested instance's own clipboard, taken only when named; voice is Voice's
# on-screen display while dictating, its plasma orb fed by stand-ins for
# voxtype's status stream and audio bridge, so no audio device opens, taken
# only when named; voice-setup is the requirement notice Voice's Set up
# raises without voxtype and Voice's Settings page then, the screen after a
# Set up run over a voxtype stand-in ended with code 0, with Voice's
# core toast or its notification card where the tree sends one, and
# Voice's Settings page once the
# stand-ins report it ready, taken only when named; voice-keys is the Keys
# section of Voice's Settings page with Voice on, then the pointer on its
# first key's info icon with that icon's tooltip open where the tree draws
# one, taken only when named; jarvis-setup is the Jarvis page's row
# actions with its daemon ready, as the settings scene readies it: the
# Settings tab's Setup section, then the Details tab at its Browser driver
# line and at its AI model section, each anchor 12 px under the page's top,
# taken only when named; outdated is the Jarvis page over a stand-in
# agent-browser and a stand-in Pi that each answer a version below the
# floor Jarvis holds them to, Pi chosen as the AI model: the Details tab
# at its Browser driver line and at the driver's line of its Requirements
# section, the Settings tab's Setup section, and the
# screen after the driver line's step is pressed, the core's requirement
# notice where the tree offers that step, over a stand-in bin/vgshell-pkg
# that answers pacman, paru and mise whatever the host runs, and that
# notice once a run of its step that changed nothing has ended, taken only
# when named; jarvis-causes plants each Jarvis start cause and
# captures its bar widget tooltip and Setup section, taken only when named;
# plugin-messages is a plugin's message to the
# user as the tree draws it, a core toast where the tree ships
# shell/Core/Toasts.qml and else its card in vgs.notifications with
# Silence off: the clipboard's paste failure, a transient message, its
# unsaved history, a lasting one, and the lock's warning that the computer
# slept unlocked, sent through the lock's own unlock path, taken only when
# named; focus is
# the keyboard focus proof set; dialog is the core's requirement notice;
# lock is the vgs.lock screen, locked and after wrong attempts; polkit is
# the vgs.polkit prompt, asking and after a failed attempt; greeter is the
# login screen, the core's greeter host over vgs.greeter's view; narrow holds a
# monitor 480 by 720 logical pixels and takes the bar, panels, devtools,
# dialog, lock, launcher, notifications and the first gallery pages again, each
# shot named <scene>-<mode>-narrow-*; theme-browser and wallpaper-browser
# are the vgs.themes browsers, taken only when named: the theme view
# loaded, with the pointer on a card, with a filter no card matches, with
# a refused card's failure line, on the chosen catalog card, on it
# installed and with its wallpaper offer; the wallpaper view on its Theme
# source, with the pointer on a card, on its download card and on All.
# Each leaves vgs and the mode's theme applied. The default is every
# other scene the tree ships, or gallery and the manager's scene with
# --rev; the manager's scene is `settings` for a tree that ships
# vgs.settings and `manager`, the bar's manager panel, for one that ships
# the bar's manager built-in. A scene the tree does not ship is refused as
# `sandbox-shots: refused: scene=<scene> tree=<rev or checkout>`. --modes is a comma list of dark,
# light and rounded, dark by default with --rev and dark and light
# otherwise: dark is the defaults (theme `vgs`), light is the tree's
# catalog package themes/catalog/flexoki-light, and rounded is the
# defaults with `radius.sm`, `radius.md` and `radius.lg` at 6, 12 and 16,
# so every theme-rounded component shows whether its content clears its
# corners. catalog-NAME is the tree's catalog package
# themes/catalog/NAME, so a shot shows a component under any catalog theme;
# a NAME the catalog lacks is refused as `sandbox-shots: refused: mode=`.
# --rev REV runs that revision's shell, bin, config and themes (git archive),
# under this checkout's harness and probe, for a before shot; the plugin
# fixtures a scene installs are that revision's, which its judge accepts.
# A scene reaches what that tree ships: the gear's and the launcher
# entries' item types, a search cleared by keys where no Clear
# search exists, and Install where a Dev Tools row has no Details.
# --scale is 1, the default, or 2: at 2 the harness holds the nested
# output at double its mode and scale 2 before the shell starts
# (shell_output_scale in scripts/smoke/harness.sh), so the layout keeps its
# logical size and the shell draws each PNG in device pixels. A configure
# the host sends the nested window, such as a resize or a refocus, resets
# a held mode (held_mode_state in scripts/smoke/mode-hold.sh), so before
# each shot and each hover under a held mode, this one or --size's, the
# run takes the mode again and puts the pointer back where the scene left
# it (settle_hold), and a shot after whose capture the output no longer
# reads the mode is taken once more (shot_held in scripts/smoke/shot.sh);
# a mode that cannot be taken again, or a second reset in that capture,
# fails the shot. Another value is refused as
# `sandbox-shots: refused: scale=<value>`.
# --size WxH holds the nested output at W by H logical pixels, at the run's
# scale, for every scene, so a shot's width does not depend on the host's
# window; another shape is refused as `sandbox-shots: refused: size=<value>`.
# --theme-card NAME is the catalog theme the theme-browser scene selects,
# frankenstein by default. A name other than lowercase letters, digits and
# hyphens is refused as `sandbox-shots: refused: theme-card=<value>`, and
# with the theme-browser scene a name the tree's catalog lacks as
# `sandbox-shots: refused: theme-card=<value> tree=<rev or checkout>`.
# theme-previews, taken only when named, applies each theme of
# --preview-themes, a comma list of package names, and shoots
# theme-preview-<name>: the theme's desktop with the standard bar widgets,
# the System window on Displays and Ghostty running tmux and Neovim from
# --dotfiles, a stow tree holding tmux/ and nvim/, with the Neovim plugins
# and tmux plugin of this user's home copied in. A catalog package's
# wallpaper is the file its --preview-wallpaper NAME=PATH names
# (scripts/theme-previews.sh passes them). A scene argument that is missing
# or names nothing is refused as `sandbox-shots: refused: <option>=<value>`.
# The lock scene enables vgs.lock with its sleep hook and idle watch off,
# locks the nested session, and shoots the lock screen, then after one and
# after ten wrong attempts. No password is typed and no PAM runs: the
# probe calls the service's `fail()`, the step PAM's refusal takes, and
# releases the lock with `sessionUnlock`, test code that never ships
# (docs/decisions/D062-native-lock-and-polkit-plugins.md). It disables the probe
# fixture, which holds `lock`, while it runs, when the settings scene
# enabled it.
# The greeter scene starts a second qs on shell/greeter.qml, as
# rows/greeter.sh does, over the smoke's fixture session directories, the
# mode's theme file and a stand-in getent that lists one fixture account,
# so no host account shows; no greetd socket exists, so nothing reaches
# PAM. It shoots once the view has chosen its session, then stops the host.
# The polkit scene builds the plugin's own Prompt.qml over a stand-in
# authentication flow the probe owns, in a stand-in of the summon host's
# overlay surface (polkitStandInOpen in scripts/smoke/Probe.qml), with
# vgs.polkit disabled, so no agent and no request exist. Nothing is typed,
# the stand-in's submit only counts, and the scene reads that no request
# went live and no authentication helper ran. The Settings scene enables
# vgs.automations over the harness's automations_stand_ins for its page's
# shot, so no call reaches the host's systemd user manager, and leaves its
# enablement as it found it: a tree with the setup steps of D061 enables
# the plugin for their Automations shot, which comes later in the same
# mode. It enables vgs.jarvis for its page's shot, once the daemon
# answers, over the J09 world the harness prepares for every sandbox
# (scripts/smoke/harness.sh), so the child reaches no audio, account,
# network or desktop, and disables it again.
# --hidden refuses every shot not taken with the nested window hidden on
# the host (SHOT_WINDOW_REQUIRE in scripts/smoke/shot.sh), so a run that
# exits 0 proves each shot's frame arrived while the window was hidden.
#
# PNGs go to DIR, which must lie under this checkout's tmp/; the default is
# tmp/sandbox-shots/<UTC time>[-REV][-x2]. shots.tsv beside them lists each shot
# with the sha256 of its file, how it was proved current, whether the host
# showed the nested window while it was taken, and whether the shot had
# chrome such as a tooltip or focus ring (shot.sh). items.tsv beside them
# lists the box of the surface's items a scene read over IPC for a shot,
# as name, x, y, width and height in device pixels, which
# scripts/readme-shots.sh's item crop cuts: the theme browser's tabs,
# selected card and name in its installed shot. Each shot is of the
# nested compositor's first output alone, which the harness sized (grim
# -o), so an output a scene adds never enters a capture. The last line
# counts the shots taken with the window hidden as hidden=N; the host
# window's state is the one read this runner makes of the host compositor
# (scripts/smoke/host-window.sh).
#
# A scene with a missing tool names itself not measured and leaves the
# other scenes running. Exit 0 when every shot was taken.
# Exit 77 when a prerequisite is missing
# or when every failure was a grim that got no frame from the nested
# compositor (nested-window=not-drawn: the host sends a hidden window no
# frame callbacks unless a host window rule gives class aquamarine
# render_unfocused, docs/architecture/validation.md § Faults). Exit 1
# when any other step or shot failed.

# A command below its version floor on the Jarvis page. The daemon's world
# copies its stand-ins when the daemon starts (scripts/lib/jarvis-env.sh),
# so its Pi is written before Jarvis is enabled, and the shell's scan reads
# the same program from the sandbox PATH. Pi's folder is added to the
# account list by hand and chosen as the AI model. The driver line's step
# is asked for through the Settings window's own act; a tree that offers no
# step there refuses it, and its third shot is the page with no notice.
# Where the notice shows, its step is then run: the stand-in terminal runs
# the update as `true`, which ends with code 0, the driver stays below its
# floor, and the last shot is the notice that comes back.

# Voice's Set up as a first-time user meets it. Without voxtype, Set up on
# the Settings window raises the core's requirement notice, which a stand-in
# bin/vgshell-pkg answers with pacman and paru, so voxtype's AUR package
# shows whatever the host runs; Escape closes it and drops the Set up it
# owed. Then a voxtype stand-in reports the speech model missing, Set up
# runs, the stand-in terminal runs `true` for the script (harness.sh's
# terminal_stand_in) and the run ends with code 0. A tree whose Voice names
# capability toasts is shot once the core toast for that end shows; one
# whose Voice names notify once Voice's card shows in vgs.notifications,
# which the scene enables with Silence off for it; an older one after a
# bounded wait. Voice's Settings page is shot without voxtype and once the

# view. A

# the section draws its chip. Enablement, stand-ins and the package script

# XDR, placed on the output by the pane's own choice, and two Studio
# Displays the helper cannot place; the fakes' system tree keeps the
# core's step probe off the host's /sys and /dev. The arrangement shows two
# monitors: the shot's own output and a second nested Wayland output placed
# as the owner's portrait 5K is, left of and above it, which the scene
# removes after the shot. A headless output stays 0x0 in the sandbox
# (scripts/smoke/mode-hold.sh); a nested Wayland output takes the mode.
# A tree that ships vgs.sound then takes its Sound section,
# system-<mode>-sound, over the sandbox's private PipeWire
# (scripts/smoke/devices.sh), with a test stream that plays in the
# sandbox's environment alone, enabled for the shot and disabled again.

# system-<mode>-mouse, over Hyprland's nested pointer list, enabled for
# the shot and disabled again, and the same section with Pointer speed
# set over the user's own line, system-<mode>-mouse-overridden: the user
# file sets the speed, so the layer applies the option, and a line after
# the VGS loading line of hyprland.lua sets another, as rows/mouse.sh
# plants it, so the row names that value and offers it. Both
