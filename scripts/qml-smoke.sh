# Run the shell inside a nested Hyprland sandbox and check it end to end.

# Usage: scripts/qml-smoke.sh [--timeout SECONDS] [--keep] [--rows NAME[,NAME...]]
#        scripts/qml-smoke.sh --first-bar-runs N [--plugin-set smoke|default] [--timeout SECONDS]
#        scripts/qml-smoke.sh --list-rows
#
# The sandbox is built from the repository alone: its own HOME, XDG dirs and
# runtime dir, a minimal compositor config, no user state. It never touches
# the live session: the nested compositor gets its own runtime dir, the
# shell is addressed through that runtime dir, and teardown kills only the
# process groups this run created.
#
# Exit 0 when every check passed. Exit 77 when a prerequisite is missing,
# naming it; when the nested compositor still lists a monitor with no size
# at the bound scripts/smoke/harness.sh names from its launch,
# nested-monitor=unsized, since it configures no bar there;
# or when a run whose only failures are geometry or render rows
# met a sandbox fault: the nested window's output rejected a state because
# its buffers could not be allocated, which the nested compositor logs as
# `Output WAYLAND-<n>: pending state rejected: swapchain failed
# reconfiguring` (a bare GBM allocation failure, which passing runs log for
# the headless output, is not that fault), or the host withheld frame
# callbacks so the shell never drew again; that is not a pass. A run whose
# every failure came after the nested output left a mode a row held,
# nested-output=mode-reset, is not a pass either.
# scripts/smoke/verdict.sh holds the verdict. Exit 1 when a check failed.
#
# --first-bar-runs N, N a positive integer, measures the first bar alone:
# it starts the sandbox N times, runs no row, and prints one line per run,
# `run=<i> latency_first_bar_ms=<ms> cpu_some_pct=<pct>
# services_released=<reason> waited_ms=<ms> nested_monitor_ready_secs=<s>`,
# the released reason and waited_ms from the service gate's release line
# (unreleased and - when it logged none), the last the harness's
# nested-monitor-ready reading, or
# `run=<i> status=not-measured exit=<status> log=<path>` for a run whose
# harness exited non-zero or read no bar. The last line is
# `qml-smoke: first-bar runs=<N> measured=<M> highest_ms=<H> budget_ms=<2H>
# highest_waited_ms=<W> deadline_ms=<2W>`, W over the runs released on a
# first frame. A run whose nested compositor stopped answering prints
# `run=<i> status=failed reason=compositor-stalled log=<path>` and the
# mode exits 1 (scripts/smoke/hypr-call.sh). Exit 0 when every run
# measured; otherwise a line naming how many did not and where their logs
# are, then exit 77. One run takes about
# 2 s. --plugin-set picks the set each run starts with: `smoke`, the rows'
# own and the default, or `default`, every first-party plugin enabled as
# in a live session (scripts/smoke/harness.sh); it needs --first-bar-runs.
#
# --rows runs only the named rows, each a name --list-rows prints, in the
# order scripts/smoke/rows.list fixes, with the harness steps between them;
# without it every row runs. It adds no row: the core rows and the rows an
# input line names come only from scripts/validate, which passes it on a
# diff-scoped run:
# docs/architecture/validation.md. A name the runner does
# not hold is refused as `qml-smoke: refused: argument=--rows value=<name>
# reason=unknown-row`. --list-rows prints the rows a run with the same
# --rows would run, one name per line in run order, and every row without
# --rows; it starts nothing. qml_smoke_wanted decides both.
#
# VGSHELL_SMOKE_RSS_CEILING_KIB: resident-size ceiling for the largest reading
# of the shells the run starts up to rows/diagnostics.sh: each shell a row
# stopped, read at its stop, and the one that row reads (shell_memory_note
# in scripts/smoke/harness.sh). A row that stops and starts the shell
# therefore hides no shell from the ceiling. It catches an allocation
# blow-up at startup or in a row and nothing else: a run this short cannot
# see growth over a session, which the sampler in docs/architecture/runtime.md
# measures, the largest reading grows with the rows the run holds, and it carries the machine's
# graphics stack. The default is twice the highest rss_peak_kib of three
# runs of this script on the owner's machine (host cachy, AMD Ryzen 9
# 9950X) on 2026-10-02, at load average 5 to 12, on one nested monitor:
# 576964 to 587008 KiB over main at 7bb195940, each the run's first shell
# read at its first stop: docs/architecture/validation.md § Latency budgets.
# Each reading prints its high-water mark beside it.
#
# VGSHELL_SMOKE_FIRST_BAR_BUDGET_MS: ceiling on the time from the runner's exec
# to the first bar surface with a client in the compositor's layer list,
# polled every 10 ms. The default is twice the highest reading of two passes
# of --first-bar-runs 12 on the owner's machine (host cachy, AMD Ryzen 9
# 9950X) on 2026-09-29, at load average 10 to 14; each pass lost one start
# to an unsized nested monitor. The 22 readings, each a start with no
# compiled QML cache, were 253 to 310 ms with cpu_some_pct at most 1.3.
# VGSHELL_SMOKE_DEFAULT_FIRST_BAR_BUDGET_MS: the same ceiling for the start
# over the default set that rows/start-order.sh reads, where every bundled
# plugin's bar widget now takes its first presence. The default is twice
# the highest kept reading of two passes of --first-bar-runs 6
# --plugin-set default on the same machine on 2026-10-05, at load average
# 11 to 15, interleaved with passes over origin/main at d1ff7b3: a pass is
# kept when every run read cpu_some_pct at most 1.3. This tree's 12 kept
# readings were 553 to 713 ms (cpu_some_pct 0.5 to 1.2); main's 11 kept
# readings, one start lost to an unsized nested monitor, were 363 to 467 ms
# (0.5 to 1.3). A pass of each with a run over 1.3 read 646 to 790 ms here
# and 412 to 523 ms on main, and is not kept.
# VGSHELL_SMOKE_RECONCILE_BUDGET_MS: ceiling on the time from a
# setPluginEnabled reply to the build records no longer listing the
# disabled widget, polled with qs ipc. The default is twice the highest
# reading of twelve runs of this script on the same machine on 2026-09-23,
# which read 12 to 15 ms.
# VGSHELL_SMOKE_EMOJI_TOAST_BUDGET_MS: ceiling on the time from the notify
# call for a Slack card with six custom emoji to its body naming the
# images on every screen. VGSHELL_SMOKE_EMOJI_INBOX_BUDGET_MS is the time
# from the history call to forty summoned-panel rows naming their emoji
# images on the visible cards (rows/notifications.sh), counted by a probe
# readback and polled back to back. Each polling turn pays about 22 ms of
# smoke IPC round-trip cost. The toast default is twice the highest reading
# of 21 runs of --rows bar,hyprland-consent,plugins,capabilities,status,
# notifications over main at b30c8a16 on the owner's machine (host cachy,
# AMD Ryzen 9 9950X) on 2026-10-06, under the fleet's load of ten lanes,
# load average 7.4 to 13.7, cpu_some_pct 0.1 to 1.7, one toast reading a
# run; one start was lost to an unsized nested monitor. The 20 readings
# were 34 to 58 ms; the nine at load average under 9 read 34 to 38 ms.
# A reading above harness.sh's latency_pressure_limit, such as one at
# cpu_some_pct 33.7 (130 ms), is unmeasured. The inbox default is twice the
# highest reading of the summoned-panel image-count reader on the same
# machine on 2026-10-01, at load average 5.58 to 8.80: 651 to 688 ms.
