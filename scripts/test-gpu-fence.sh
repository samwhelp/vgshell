#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Drive scripts/smoke/gpu-fence.sh over trees of ordinary files: a sysfs
# tree that names each node's driver, and a device tree that holds a file
# for each node and the links to it. No case reads /sys/class/drm or
# /dev/dri, and none opens a device node. The namespace cases make a real
# bubblewrap namespace over the device tree; the refusal cases put a
# stand-in bwrap, or none, on PATH. In the trees the amdgpu nodes are card1
# and renderD128, so a fence that went by a fixed number hides the wrong
# ones.
#
# Each case pins the exit status and the keyed lines the fence's header
# promises. The proof lines are pinned whole: the orchestrator reads them
# as the evidence that a run was restricted.
#
# The stop cases send TERM, INT or HUP to a fence whose command has an exit
# trap that takes a second. The command must get the signal once, and its
# trap must have ended when the fence returns. The carry case sends INT
# while the command waits on a foreground command that exits 0, which bash
# carries on from, then TERM, which must end the run. The terminal case
# runs the fence from a real terminal, where a command that changes the
# terminal's mode or reads it must not stop. A SIGKILL of the fence must end every
# process its command started, one in another session and one stopped
# included. The cases that can leave a process run in a PID namespace of
# their own that util-linux unshare makes, whose end ends what a defect
# leaves.
#
# The controls plant one defect per rule in a copy of the fence and
# require the case that rule owns to go red. The first is the fence with
# no restriction: its namespace covers nothing, and the proof inside
# reports every amdgpu path it still sees, by stat, and starts nothing. A
# control whose label no case carries is a failure, never a pass: a planted
# one must turn the controls loop red.
#
# The wiring cases run a copy of each entry point beside a stand-in fence.
# Each must hand its own path and arguments to the fence before it makes
# anything, and go on by itself where the fence's check passes. The tree
# holds a stand-in for what an entry point reads before the fence. A copy of
# the harness, cut after its check, must stop where the check fails, having
# started none of its tools but pkg-config, which its prerequisite check
# asks first. The stand-ins for the harness's tools are the list the
# harness itself prints with nothing on PATH.
#
# Exit 0 when every case and control holds, 1 otherwise, 77 when
# bubblewrap cannot make a namespace here, since the namespace cases then
# measured nothing:
#   test-gpu-fence: status=not-measured missing=bwrap-namespace
