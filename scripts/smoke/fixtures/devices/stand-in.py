"""A device command's stand-in in the smoke sandbox's shim directory.

Usage: stand-in.py NAME STATE ARG...

scripts/smoke/devices.sh writes $shim/NAME as a two-line script that
runs this with NAME, its state directory STATE and the caller's argv.
No stand-in runs the host's command: each records its argv and answers
from files a row plants under STATE.

- Every call appends its argv as one JSON list line to
  STATE/calls/NAME.calls. A bluetoothctl transcript also appends each
  stdin line it reads, as {"stdin": LINE}, and {"eof": true} when its
  stdin ends past the last step.
- rfkill keeps STATE/rfkill.json, {"devices": [{"id", "type", "device",
  "soft", "hard"}]} with "blocked" or "unblocked", as its only state: it
  lists it as util-linux's rfkill does and block, unblock and toggle
  change the soft state of the devices that one or more IDs, TYPEs,
  aliases or `all` select. A hard block is never changed, as on real
  hardware; a row moves it with set_hard. While STATE/bluez-follow.json
  holds {"adapter": PATH, "autoEnable": BOOL}, each block, unblock or
  toggle of a Bluetooth radio, and each set_hard, moves that adapter of
  the sandbox's BlueZ mock as bluetoothd follows rfkill: blocked, Powered
  false and PowerState off-blocked; unblocked, Powered true and
  PowerState on with autoEnable, else PowerState off and Powered left
  false. The mock is reached on the system bus the caller's environment
  names, the sandbox's.
- bluetoothctl with no argument, or with exactly `--agent CAPABILITY` as
  the core's Bluetooth agent starts it, replays STATE/replies/bluetoothctl
  .transcript.json, a list of {"out": TEXT}, printed at once,
  {"in": LINE}, which reads one stdin line and ends with status 1 when it
  differs, {"wait": NAME}, which waits up to 30 s for STATE/NAME to exist,
  records {"waited": NAME} and ends with status 1 when it does not, and
  {"pair": ADDRESS}, which
  marks device ADDRESS of the BlueZ mock's hci0 paired, as BlueZ does once
  the agent's answer completes bonding; past the last step it records
  stdin until EOF.
- pw-play, the core's sound player, exits 0 after its record: it plays
  nothing, and its caller reads no answer but its exit. So does
  system-config-printer, which vgs.printers starts detached and opens no
  window.
- lpstat and ipptool answer from the sandbox's CUPS world, STATE/cups.json,
  as cups.py beside this file sets out.
- pactl --format=json subscribe follows STATE/pactl.events, a FIFO the
  Sound row plants. STATE/pactl.subscriber contains its PID while alive.
  It forwards each newline-delimited JSON event, never calls host pactl.
- Any other call answers from STATE/replies/NAME.json, a list of
  {"argv", "stdout", "stderr", "status"} rows, the row whose argv equals
  the call's. device_reply keeps one row per argv and replaces older rows.
  A reply may name a "wait" marker relative to STATE. It snapshots its
  reply, records STATE/<marker>.waiting, and waits for STATE/<marker>
  before publishing that reply, to control an asynchronous read race.
  A call no row answers prints the line
  `stand-in: name=NAME reply=none argv=<json>` on stderr and exits 1, so
  a caller never reads an answer no row planted.
