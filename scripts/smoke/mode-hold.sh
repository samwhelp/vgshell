# off it, and that is not what a held row measures. Aquamarine's Wayland
# backend turns every xdg_toplevel configure the host sends the nested
# window into a state event with the configure's size
# (CWaylandOutput::CWaylandOutput in src/backend/Wayland.cpp, aquamarine
# v0.15.1), and the host sends one whenever it resizes the window or
# changes its state, focus and tiling included, and whenever another
# window on the nested window's host workspace unmaps (CWindow's unmap
# path calls forceReportSizesToWindows, Hyprland v0.56.2). For a
# Wayland-backend output, Hyprland's state listener applies the active
# rule again with that size in place of the rule's mode, unless the two
# are equal (CMonitor::onConnect in src/output/Monitor.cpp, Hyprland
# v0.56.2). The rule keeps its scale, and CMonitor::applyMonitorRule moves
# a scale that leaves fractional logical pixels to the nearest one that
# does not: a 1755x933 window under a 3510x1866 hold at scale 2 reads
# 1755x933 at scale 1.5. A hold at the window's own size survives a
# configure of the same size and no resize. Each applied rule, the host's
# size included, becomes the active rule (CMonitor::applyMonitorRuleSoft,
# same file), so after a resize away a configure back to the window's own
# size differs from the active rule and gives the output that size again:
# a scale-1 hold at the window's own size comes back without its rule, and
# a reading after both configures reads `held`. No host configure equals a
# doubled mode, so a scale-2 hold comes back only through its rule applied
# again (hold_restore), or a configuration reload, which the shell runs
# when its Hyprland layer changes: a reload drops every rule `hyprctl
# eval` added (src/config/lua/ConfigManager.cpp, CConfigManager::reload,
# v0.56.2) and applies the rule mode_hold_file names again. The shell
