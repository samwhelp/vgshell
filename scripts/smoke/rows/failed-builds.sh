# A plugin whose entry points cannot take what the core assigns is not
# built and keeps nothing it was lent: no hold, no background surface.
# It reads what rows/capability-release.sh leaves: acme.probe disabled, so
# the lock the broken fixture asks for is free and acme.tick stands alone
# in the centre section. While acme.probe holds the lock the core waits
# and builds nothing, so it refuses nothing.
# It owes no restart notice either, though rows/manager.sh has planted its
# control copies in the sandbox's shell/ by then, so the core differs from
# the one the shell started over: the engine loaded the fixture's files.
