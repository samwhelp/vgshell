# Pane kind and panes capability: a holder window lists enabled pane
# plugins, mounts a pane with that pane plugin's own shell, owns one mount
# at a time and refuses a second panes holder while it holds the capability.

# the plugin reads: the service, the widget, the pane and the Settings page.
# Its control is a copy whose core stops handing a widget the row's changes.
# A pane plugin's Settings page ends with a button named for the enabled
# holder, absent for a plugin without kind pane and while no holder is
# enabled, whose press opens the holder on that plugin's pane; a copy whose
# rows give every plugin the holder and whose press drops the pane is the
# control.
# The row sets vgs.system and every enabled shipped section aside first, so
