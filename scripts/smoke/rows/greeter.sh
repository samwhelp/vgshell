# The login screen, vgs.greeter (D101, docs/decisions/D101-greeter-host-and-greeter-system-step.md).
#
# Its service in the running shell: the harness starts it disabled, and the
# row enables it over the device fakes' system tree, where
# rows/system-steps.sh's stand-in systemctl answers greetd.service's load
# state, so the core's step probe reaches no host unit. The row reads the
# lending record name vgs.greeter the one holder of `system` and lend it
# the greeter step alone, and the `greeter` status its service publishes
# from that reading, then plants a masked greetd, rescans, and reads both
# follow it, its control: the status is the step's reading, not a constant.
# Disabling the plugin drops its status record and its hold.
#
# The core's greeter host: the row starts a second qs on shell/greeter.qml
# with VGS_GREETER_VIEW naming the plugin's view, XDG_DATA_DIRS naming two
# fixture directories under scripts/smoke/fixtures/greeter, a theme
# directory holding the fixture theme copy, `theme.json` and a
# `background` image, as the service writes it, an empty state directory,
# and no greetd socket. It reads the host's view line, greetd unavailable,
# the theme and the background the view loaded from the copy, the three
# sessions the view lists of the eight fixture files (a Hidden file
# deleting the later directory's file of the same name, a NoDisplay entry,
# a TryExec not found and a file with no Exec left out, the last refused by
# path), the X entry available only while startx is on the sandbox's PATH,
# the uwsm-managed Hyprland session preselected on first use, and its
# surface on the overlay layer, each from the lines the host and the view
# print for the journal. It then starts the host again over a state
# directory whose `greeter.json` names the caller as the last user and the
# plain Hyprland entry as their session, as the view writes it before a
# launch, and reads that entry preselected: the next boot's choice. That
# start's GREETD_SOCK names fixtures/greeter/greetd.py, a stand-in greetd
# started before it, which answers greetd's protocol with one password and
# logs each request. The row types a wrong password and reads greetd's
# auth_error as an auth failure and the client's cancel; presses Enter
# with the field empty, which starts a login that waits at the hidden
# prompt, and Escape, which cancels it; then types the right password and
# reads the chosen session's command and environment reach start_session
# and the host end on its own, exit 0, with no surface left. The control
# starts the host again with a view reached through `..` outside the
# plugin tree: it prints the refusal, builds no surface and exits 1. No
# greetd, PAM or sudo is reached; rows/auth-sentinel.sh reads the log
# empty. The host's reads wait up to 20 s, 100 reads 0.2 s apart, for a qs
# start with no compiled QML cache; every other reading is expect_poll's:
# 25 reads 0.2 s apart.
