# Unsaved edits on a Settings page. The row installs
# its own fixture, acme.unsaved, whose page draws an unbounded number, Gap,
# in a text field, a preset string, Label, with its Custom text field, a
# list, Notes, whose one item holds a number, Size, in a text field and a
# switch, Wide, and Open for the fixture's window, and works it with the
# nested seat's pointer
# and keys. A typed value shows
# the save bar and writes nothing, and a loss of focus writes nothing
# either. Discard puts the saved value back; Save writes shell.json, the
# bar reads Saved and leaves; Ctrl+S writes every edited field; Enter
# writes the field it is pressed in and Escape there puts that field back.
# A list item's typed value waits the same way and outlives a write of the
# list by the item's switch, and the bar's Save, pressed by the keyboard, hands the
# keyboard to the tab strip as it leaves. A value the manager refuses stays
# in its field with the bar, and the prompt's Save with one stays on the
# page. Open summons the fixture's window and asks nothing. With an
# edit pending, the Details tab by a click and by Ctrl+Tab, the back
# button, Escape, a jump to another plugin, a deep link to another page and
# a hide by the shell each raise one prompt: Escape, a press beside the
# card and Cancel stay, Discard leaves without a write and Save writes and
# leaves; a deep link to the page shown asks nothing, and a second hide
# raises no second prompt. A close through Hyprland asks nothing and writes
# nothing, and a plugin disabled under an edit drops it. On the Settings
# plugin's own page a key typed as text waits the same way, as the page's
# only edit it holds the Details tab behind the prompt, and a refused one
# returns to its text entry.
# A settings row written outside the page: a second fixture, acme.outside,
# a service and a bar widget whose settings live in its plugins row alone,
# draws a switch, Compact, a segmented control, Mode, and a Custom text
# field, Label. A row an editor saves over the user file while the page is
# open redraws all three; one saved while the window is closed draws on
# the next open; the widget reads the same row, and its layout entry holds
# its id alone.
# Controls. A copy of the Settings plugin, installed over the shipped one,
# whose text field writes when it loses focus, whose bar is bound to no
# edit, whose Discard and Ctrl+S do nothing and whose window asks nothing
# before it leaves: the same readers read a write after Tab, a bar that
# stays after Save, a typed value that outlives Discard, no write on Ctrl+S
# and a page left at once with no prompt. A copy of the tree whose list
# hands its item fields no set and keys its items by nothing, whose page
# moves no keyboard when its last edit goes, whose key field
# reads its text entry's visibility, whose window host asks no instance
# before it hides, whose window leaves after a refused save and whose
# configuration keeps the user file it read first: the same
# readers read no bar over a list item's typed value and that value gone
# after the switch's write, the keyboard off the strip after the bar's Save,
# Details shown over a typed key with no prompt, a hide that closes the
# window with its edit lost, a page popped with its refused value, and the
# outside fixture's page and widget left on the old row once the copy has
# read a newer one.
# No latency is measured; each reading polls every 200 ms for up to 5 s.
# The bar holds its Saved line for saveBar.duration, 1600 ms, and fades for
# motion.duration.normal, 150 ms (Tokens.js), so the control waits 3 s
# before it reads a bar still drawn.
