# Plugin messages: the fixture service sends system notifications through
# its `notify` capability, and the row reads them back as the cards
# vgs.notifications draws, its saved History, the fixture's own
# notification subscription and the shell log. A card names the fixture's
# manifest name as its sender and carries the tone, icon and urgency it
# was sent with, the bell for a message sent with neither tone nor icon,
# and a click that only dismisses; its message arrives with
# `&`, `<` and `>` escaped, since the server reads a body as markup. A
# transient message's card leaves a History entry as a lasting one's
# does. Under Silence a critical message still draws its card, as the
# x-vgs-plugin hint the core adds lets it, and a normal one goes to History
# unseen. Each malformed option is refused with its key, and a burst past
# the run ceiling is refused as busy. With vgs.notifications disabled the
# fixture's own subscription keeps the core's server up and the fixture
# receives the message; with no plugin holding the `notifications` role,
# acme.notifier's message is dropped and the shell logs one unsent line.
