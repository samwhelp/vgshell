# Control for scripts/smoke/rows/notices.sh's enable trigger: a copy of the
# tree whose Plugins.setEnabled no longer calls Notices.enabled runs as the
# guarded shell, and enabling acme.needs, which still misses a command it
# needs, must raise no notice. Notices.enabled runs before setPluginEnabled
# replies, so the lending record read after the reply is decisive. The same
# copy is the control for pluginInstalled's wait in rows/notices.sh: when a
# scan ends, its Notices runs only the callbacks waiting for an earlier
# scan, so pluginInstalled's one scan lands and raises no notice. The notice
# is raised in the turn the revision reaches the scan, so a read once
# scanRevision reaches it is decisive. The copy's Notices.dismiss also
# records no rest, the control for rows/notices.sh's rest after Not now:
# an offer raises the notice, Escape closes it, and the same reading of the
# lending record finds the plugin's offers not resting. The copy
# holds its own bin/, since bin/vgshell finds the tree from its own real path,
# and its own shell/; config/ and themes/ are links to the sandbox's. The
# row stops the shell rows/read-only-prefix.sh started, starts the copy
# through harness.sh's start_shell and leaves it running for
# rows/hidpi.sh, which stops it.
