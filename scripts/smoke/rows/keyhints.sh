# Key Hints. SUPER+SLASH, typed on the nested seat, opens one window that
# draws one row for each bind of an enabled first-party plugin: the same
# set as the binds `hyprctl -j binds` reports with a `vgs.` description in
# the default submap, a hold's release companion folded into its bind, and
# one row with no key for a bind that has none. The row enables Voice for
# that keyless bind, its tap shortcut, whatever set the shell started over,
# and unbinds the tap from its row, then resets it, which binds its default
# keys again; with Voice disabled the window draws the same keyed rows and
# no Voice tap row, the keyless reading's control. It then leaves Voice as
# it found it. A harness user bind on SUPER+SHIFT+T, the Themes shortcut's default key, shows
# the hint under the Themes row with no key or click. Typing while the
# Themes row's field has the focus goes into the search field and filters
# the rows, and clearing the search draws them all again. A key typed into
# the Themes row's field is written to the Themes `plugins[].keys` in
# shell.json. A key the manager refuses leaves shell.json as it was and
# reads over the rows as the shared reply line says it, from the manager's
# own key judge under node; the next saved key clears it. The Settings
# page's Keys row for the same shortcut shows the
# same hint, and the same key written from there is the same shell.json
# value, which this window then shows. The row's unbind writes null: the
# bind leaves `hyprctl binds` and its row stays. SUPER+SLASH closes the
# window, opens it again, and the window is then read as every
# application window is (app_window_rows, scripts/smoke/app-window.sh),
# ending closed by Escape. The control starts a tree whose window lists
# every plugin's binds, enabled or not, and whose rows name no bind for
# their field, and disables the launcher, which owns a bind, whatever set
# the shell started over: its rows hold a bind `hyprctl binds` does not
# and the Themes row shows no hint. It leaves the launcher as it found it.
# Every key goes to the nested instance alone, through wtype on its seat,
# with `input:resolve_binds_by_sym` on so a typed key reaches its bind,
# since a bind resolves a virtual keyboard's key only by keysym, and the
# row puts the harness hyprland.lua
# back at its end.
# The open budget is the owner's 200 ms. VGS-1057's nested baseline on
# 2026-10-07 on host cachy built 34 rows with all 32 shipped plugins enabled: the first
# native frame took 4478 ms (tmp/VGS-1057/baseline.json). The timer reads
# the shortcut handler and QQuickWindow.frameSwapped, before visibility;
# polling every 200 ms only waits for those timestamped readings. CPU
# pressure spans shortcut send through native-frame readback; each open
# prints its actual pressure sampling interval. Readings above harness.sh's
# shared CPU pressure limit are unmeasured, including fast readings.
# The four later opens are judged by the fastest one at or below that
# limit. Contention the CPU pressure does not read, such as the GPU, I/O or
# the nested compositor, only adds time to an open, so one slow open beside
# faster ones is the host; a product regression slows every open. The main
# batches 20261008T083545Z to 20261011T032242Z on cachy (VGS-1356) read
# 145 later opens at or below the limit, median 124 ms, three over 200 ms
# (215, 219, 222), each in a run whose fastest later open read 165 ms or less.
# Restoring eager Tooltip window construction must exceed the same budget.
# The first frame holds the groups that fill the window, and each open
# polls for the rows built behind it; a copy that never builds them is the
# control. This row's timing marks, with marks around the plugin build and
# the first animation tick added, on 2026-10-12 on cachy at 5e0f29a0 with
# 42 plugins and CPU pressure under 2%: building every row first took 69 to
# 113 ms of opens of 146 to 261 ms and the frame's own 55 to 86 ms; with
# the first frame's groups alone the build took 38 to 54 ms and the frame
# was swapped 92 to 126 ms after the shortcut.
# Hyprland consent wires the shortcuts before this row types its open key.
