# The theme capability, driven through the fixture service and read back
# from what its callbacks received, from its `shell.theme` members, from
# Theme itself and from the core's lending record. rows/theme.sh ends at
# the defaults; the first apply is the vgs package all the same.
# `done` can run before ThemeSource reloads the file, so `current` and
# `revision` are polled after it. A later block installs a copy of the
# catalog's flexoki-light, a light package, applies it and reads one colour
# of each gallery section back as a property, then applies vgs so later
# rows start from the defaults. The vgs.themes
# block and its wallpaper block close the file, each delimited by its own
# markers.

# Install browser theming, D061: the service publishes what `vgshell theme
# setup` says of the Chromium-family writer. The sandbox tree ships no
# target, so the row reads not shipped until the row copies the chromium
# target in and the service starts again. qml-smoke.sh hides the host's
# writer from every sandbox shell, and chromium resolves to the device
# fakes' stand-in (scripts/smoke/devices.sh), so on any host the Settings page
# then offers Install browser theming, whose button opens the plugin's
# browser-policy TUI. The stand-in terminal runs no plugin script
# (scripts/test-themes-browser-policy-tui.sh runs this one), and the
# sandbox tree's bin/vgshell-browser-policy stays the harness's sentinel. The
# row holds the run live, reads the argv the press handed the terminal,
# then puts a stand-in writer on the shell's PATH itself, the state the
# run's end reads, and releases the run. The run's end then reads
# Installed and withdraws the button. The control: the manager refuses the
# act while the tree ships no target and once the writer is there. Then
# Settings itself: each open asks for a scan, so a writer that arrives
# with no scan of the row's own reads installed once the window opens
# again, and a Settings copy whose open() asks for none leaves the row
# offering the install. The target leaves the tree before any apply.

# pixels at the scale the sandbox holds. A headless second monitor
# draws an image set on it alone while the first screen draws `current`. A

# reloads the state file and a copy of the background that is always shown
