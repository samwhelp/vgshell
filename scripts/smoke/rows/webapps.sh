# Web Apps, vgs.webapps: a site made an app from the Settings window, found
# in the launcher by its name with its icon, opened in its own window and
# focused on the next selection, and removed with its entry and icon.
# The row's world lives under $sandbox/webapps and the sandbox's own home:
# a site python3's http.server serves on the loopback address, one page
# with a title and an icon link and one with neither; a stand-in browser
# that logs its arguments and runs the harness's toplevel helper with the
# class a Chromium-family browser gives a site opened with --app; its
# desktop entry, vgs-smoke-browser.desktop, a web browser whose Exec names
# it by its path; and a mimeapps.list that makes it the https default. No
# host browser can open: before Web Apps starts, the row hides each host
# desktop entry the service would take for a browser behind a Hidden=true
# shadow in the sandbox's data home (scripts/smoke/webapps-browsers.sh),
# and every selection first reads the browser the service names, the
# stand-in or none, and selects nothing when it names another. No shell is
# started again: the PATH stays the harness's.
# Read back: the desktop entry the service writes, its Name the page's
# title and its Icon the page's icon, byte for byte; the launcher's row by
# that name with its icon drawn; one launch with --app=<address> and one
# window of the class; a second selection from the launcher that launches
# nothing and gives that window the keyboard; Remove taking the entry, the
# icon and the launcher's row away. The controls: with the shadows up and
# the stand-in's entry not yet written, the service names no browser and a
# selection shows its message, launches nothing and maps no window; a page
# with no icon, whose app takes the plugin's default icon, so the first
# icon reading cannot pass on the default; and a window of another class
# open before the first selection, which still launches.
# The row closes every window it opened or the stand-in browser mapped,
# stops the site, removes what it planted, on every exit path for what it
# planted in the data home, and leaves Web Apps, the launcher and Settings
# as it found them, and shell.json as it was.
# No latency is measured; each reading polls every 200 ms for up to 5 s,
# but for what Quickshell's desktop entry index gives, which follows a
# write in the data home late in the full row order: the service's browser
# and the launcher's first listing are polled every 200 ms for up to
# wa_index_s.
