# Dictation, capability `dictation` (D106), over the voxtype stand-in on
# the shell's PATH (scripts/smoke/fixtures/voxtype/): the daemon the core
# starts, its status follower and every record verb are the stand-in, whose
# daemon hears the words the row writes and types through the wtype
# stand-in beside it. No row reaches the host's voxtype, its daemon, a
# microphone or the host's wtype.
#
# The fixtures acme.dictation and acme.dictation-other hold the capability
# and drive it over IPC. Rows, on the tree:
# - with no holder, the sandbox holds no stand-in process;
# - a holder starts one daemon and one follower, children of the shell;
# - one `text` request hands the stand-in's words to the stop's callback
#   and leaves no file in the 0700 dictation directory;
# - a second holder's start during the first's recording is refused and
#   names the holder, and the second records once the first is done;
# - a `type` recording goes to the stand-in's own output, the wtype
#   stand-in;
# - disabling a holder cancels its recording and keeps the daemon for the
#   other;
# - with the stand-in's cap at 3 s, a `text` recording never stopped is
#   cancelled by the core: the daemon notes a cancel and no cap, and the
#   wtype stand-in recorded no call;
# - with a stand-in daemon that takes the start and cannot capture, the
#   stop hands over empty and the next start is taken;
# - disabling the last holder during a `text` recording cancels it before
#   the daemon ends, so no file override outlives the daemon, and the next
#   daemon's `type` recording is typed;
# - with a stand-in daemon the row started, the holder reads `elsewhere`,
#   its start is refused, no second daemon was tried, and a restart after
#   that daemon ended reads ready;
# - with the shell killed during a `text` recording, its runner stopped so
#   that no shell comes back first, no stand-in process remains and the
#   wtype stand-in recorded no call.
# Controls, each its own edit of one copy of the tree, started in place of
# the tree: a probe that reads no daemon tries a second one, which the
# stand-in refuses; a `text` start that arms no deadline reaches the cap,
# which types; children started without the parent-death signal outlive
# the killed shell, and the cap types; a last release that ends no child
# leaves the daemon with no holder. A second copy, whose last release sends
# no cancel, leaves the file override, and the next daemon's `type`
# recording goes to a file and is not typed. The row ends with a fresh
# shell of the tree, both fixtures disabled and the stand-ins put away.
# Every poll is expect_poll's, one read each 0.2 s; no latency budget is
# claimed.
