# The theme capability's members for the theme and wallpaper browsers:
# catalog, install, images, set and wallpapers, driven through the fixture
# service and read back from what its callbacks received, from `last` and
# from the core's lending record. catalog, install, images and set, one
# screen's and every screen's included, run the sandbox's real runner on
# the shipped catalog and on an installed package with two images.
# wallpapers runs on the download lane: the real runner for a refusal, a
# stand-in for a slow download, since the sandbox reaches no network, and
# a stand-in that records the arguments of the update form. The stand-in prints two progress lines, then polls
# its gate every 50 ms for at most 30 s, long enough for an apply and a
# rebuild of the fixture to finish behind it. rows/themes.sh defines the
# helpers used here and leaves vgs applied, Black current and the fixture
# disabled; this file leaves them so.
