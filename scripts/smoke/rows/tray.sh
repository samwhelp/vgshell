# The tray over two stand-in tray apps, scripts/smoke/fixtures/tray/mock-sni.py,
# which run on the sandbox's private session bus alone: their starter takes
# an environment of its own, the sandbox bus its only D-Bus address, and
# refuses any other address, the owner's bus among them, and an empty one,
# which its control reads with a stand-in spawn that starts nothing. With
# vgs.tray enabled and placed, the row reads both apps' icons in the drawer
# and the `items` choices the service publishes; the drawer opening while
# the pointer rests on the arrow and closing once it leaves, from the drawn
# clip's width and the reveal at 1 and at 0; the arrow staying put on the
# screen while the drawer opens, and a click on it then holding the drawer
# open and activating no app; a left click reaching the app as Activate; a
# right click opening the app's menu, a double click on Accounts opening
# its submenu, with a Back entry named after the app, and reaching nothing
# with its second click, sent once Sign in is drawn under a motion scale
# that stretches the menu's guard to 1000 ms, Back and Accounts again, and
# Sign in reaching the app as its menu event once; Pin in the drawn Manage tray icons popover,
# opened from the frame menu on the arrow, moving the app to the pinned
# row, into the user file, and keeping it there after a shell restart,
# which the apps follow by registering again; and Hide taking the other
# app off the bar. Each click is a real one on the drawn item through the
# pointer helper. Controls, each a copy of vgs.tray installed as a user
# plugin of its own id with one edit: an arrow at the widget's left edge,
# left of the drawer, which moves as the drawer opens; a menu without the
# guard after a level change, whose double click on Accounts sends Sign
# in; a menu without the drill-down, whose Accounts triggers instead, so
# Sign in is never drawn; a service that drops the manage write, which
# logs each drop, so the restart reads the app unpinned; a reveal held at
# 0, so the clip stays shut under the hover; and a left click that calls
# the secondary action, so the app records no Activate. The row stops the
# apps, restores the user file and the theme file, reads the tray's
# settings back, removes its copies and puts the pointer back.
# This row has no latency ceiling; every reading polls through expect_poll.
