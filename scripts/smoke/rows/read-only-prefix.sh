# Measured on host cachy, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, 2026-09-29. This row adds no
# latency budget. It starts the installed shell through harness.sh's
# start_shell, with the process-signalling stand-ins first on its PATH,
# so it reuses the smoke startup poll intervals: 10 ms for the first bar
# and one `vgshell ipc` round trip for readiness. Its `theme apply` writes
# under a state home of the row's own: the vgs package names a background,
# and in the sandbox's shared state directory the repository shell this
# row restores would draw it, a layer no row before it left.
