# The polkit agent, vgs.polkit: a first-party service and overlay. The
# harness starts it disabled, since polkit is exclusive and the capability
# rows' fixture, acme.probe, holds it. This row disables the fixture when
# an earlier row left it enabled, enables vgs.polkit once no plugin holds
# polkit, reads the agent the core lends it
# and the agent status its service publishes back, asserts that no prompt
# surface exists without an authentication flow and that a summon with none
# is refused, and disables it again, which destroys the agent.
#
# A live flow cannot run here: it needs polkitd and the setuid
# polkit-agent-helper-1, which would run PAM against the real account and
# could trip pam_faillock. The sandbox's system bus has no polkitd, so the
# agent stays unregistered. The row reads that no flow ever went live, from
# the core's count over the shell's whole life, which the row never
# restarts, and that the harness's helper watcher saw no
# polkit-agent-helper-1 or other authentication helper over the whole row;
# the lock row's stand-in is the watcher's control. What the prompt draws from a flow is
# scripts/test-polkit-model.js's.
#
# The control installs a copy of the plugin in the user directory, whose id
# wins, with the prompt's refusal of a flowless summon removed: the same
# summon reading maps a prompt then, so the reading is not vacuous.
#
# Another agent in the way. A stand-in polkitd, fixtures/polkit/authority.py,
# joins the sandbox's system bus: it takes one agent, refuses a second, and
# never begins an authentication. A stand-in agent, fixtures/polkit/agent.py
# run from a copy of the Python interpreter named polkit-acme-agent,
# registers with it first. A stand-in pacman in the shell's stand-in
# directory is the package manager: it names acme-polkit as the owner of
# that program, and its removal dry run answers from a file the row plants,
# so the row reads Uninstall while nothing requires the package and Stop
# while another installed package does; the two readings are each other's
# control. The row presses each through the Settings window's act and reads
# the plugin's own TUI in the argv the stand-in terminal recorded. That
# terminal runs no shipped script, so the row ends the stand-in agent
# itself while the run is held, as the step does, and reads that VGS's agent
# registers when the run ends, in the shell the row started with. In the
# Stop stage a second stand-in agent runs, the same interpreter copied as
# polkit-beta-agent, which pacman names as beta-polkit's: the row reads
# that the status value names both and that the page draws one Badge for
# each. The Uninstall stage, with one agent, reads one Badge and is that
# reading's control. A program
# `stop` recorded is ended by the service's own check, with no press. The
# last control removes every service registration trigger. It keeps the
# already-refused agent for a new check, so initial registration cannot race
# the check that ends the recorded program. The host needs pacman
# as its primary package manager, as the Dev Tools row does. The row ends
# with vgs.polkit disabled and the fixture as it found it.
#
# The row reads no latency: each reading polls at the harness's interval
# until the harness's ceiling.
