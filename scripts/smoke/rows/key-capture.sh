# Key capture, D067. The Settings window's Keys row takes a key combo by
# its keys. Tab presses on the nested seat reach the Settings shortcut's
# field, which shows its focus ring; Return starts a capture, which puts
# the nested Hyprland in the vgs:passthrough submap; and SUPER+SPACE,
# CTRL+ALT+T and F5, each held by a harness user bind that touches a
# marker, reach the field instead of the bind. Each capture stores the
# string the field's text entry stores when the same keys are typed into
# it, the submap is left once it commits, and the field names the
# Launcher shortcut and the user bind holding SUPER+SPACE. A captured
# SUPER+SHIFT+T names the Themes plugin, whose shortcut asks for the same key,
# and the field's Unbind button, clicked, stores null; Themes ends the row
# enabled or disabled as the row found it, since the themes row leaves
# Black current and an enabled Themes draws it. The control starts a tree whose key capture owner
# sends no enter: Hyprland stays in its default map, the user bind takes
# SUPER+SPACE, its marker appears and the stored key stays. Every key goes
# to the nested instance alone, through wtype on its seat, and the row
# puts the harness hyprland.lua back at its end.
# Each step that stores a key or enables a plugin rewrites the layer, and
# the shell's reload after that write leaves the pass-through submap, so a
# capture waits until Hyprland holds the bind the step wrote. The control
# for that wait asks the shell to write the layer and reload Hyprland once
# a capture entered the submap: the reload leaves it and the shell ends
# the capture on Hyprland's submap change.
# No latency is measured; each reading polls every 200 ms.
