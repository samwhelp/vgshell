# A fixture plugin in the sandbox user directory: kind service plus a bar
# widget, naming every capability. Proves user-directory discovery, the
# service host, that each instance receives exactly the capabilities its
# manifest names, that a settings change reaches a running instance without
# a rebuild, and that every capability delivers its object and releases it
# on disable. The service registers through its capabilities once and
# answers IPC calls that drive the rest. The rows read the fixture's own
# properties back through readInstance, never the build records.
# A rescan answers with the scan revision its scan ends at, and the
# harness's rescan reads the shell's state only once that scan has landed.
# Its controls hold a scan behind a gate: the revision stays short of the
# one named and the listing keeps the last scan's state until the gate
# opens; a copy of rescan that does not wait reads that old state; a
# rescan queued behind a held scan that read the files before a change
# names the revision after it and reads the change; and a copy of the
# tree whose Registry names the revision before its scan, run as the
# guarded shell, lets rescan read the last scan's state. That copy stops
# the row's shell and the row starts the sandbox's tree again after it.
# A disable calls the service's turnedOff() once; a rebuild after a source
# change and a shell stop call it never. Its control is a copy of the tree
# whose core calls it for every destroyed instance: the rebuild then leaves
# the fixture's mark.
