# The user's Appearance values over the theme (D104): capability
# `appearance`, the one writer of shell.json `appearance`, Theme's one
# resolution of it, the Hyprland layer that writes it, and the Motion,
# Windows, UI and Fonts sections of the System window that set it.
#
# Through the acme.appearance fixture the row writes a corner radius of 12
# and reads it in the file, in the capability, in the window radius token,
# in a flyout's token at 12 * 0.75 = 9, in a menu entry that follows its
# menu, in the nested Hyprland's rounding and in its group tab rounding at
# half the radius times the layer's highest monitor scale; it reads that the
# capability refuses Use my Hyprland value for the control radius and writes
# nothing, that a motion style reaches the Hyprland preset, and that an
# unset puts the theme's values back. An interface font of the bundled
# JetBrains Mono reaches the reading text, and one of the bundled Inter
# Variable the capitals of the bar and of labels while code keeps the
# fixed-width family; a terminal font sets no token and ends with a theme
# follow, which the runner logs, and a family that holds a line break is
# refused. Only the fixture holds the capability.
#
# In the Windows section it reads the corner radius Set by theme, clicks the
# slider to about 24, adds a user line `rounding = 10` after the VGS loading line,
# reads that the section's value holds over it and that the row names the
# user's 10, clicks Use my Hyprland value and reads the setting, the layer's
# radius group and VGS's rounding gone, Hyprland's 10 shown and the keys on
# the slider, then Use theme value. A section a click on the sidebar opens
# shows no focus ring. In the Motion
# section Space turns Motion off and every duration goes still, Use theme
# value moves them again, and Window animations writes Hyprland's
# animations. In the UI section End sets the control radius to 16 for
# buttons, text fields and segmented controls. In the Fonts section the
# keys start on the interface font's select, Down chooses the next family
# the list offers, which the reading text and the bar then draw in, and Use theme
# value puts the theme's back. The row takes three names from fontconfig in
# the shell's environment, each the first one Qt lists too: a proportional
# name, one fontconfig lists for no fixed-width font; an icon name, the
# first name of a fixed-width font that misses a printable ASCII character,
# such as an icon or emoji font, that no fixed-width font covering them
# shares; and a style name, one fontconfig lists for a font that no font has
# as its first name. The terminal font's list holds a family and neither the
# proportional nor the icon name, and the interface font's list holds a
# family and not the style name. A click opens the terminal font's list,
# Down and Enter choose its first family, and the choice ends with a follow.
# A sandbox with no such name leaves that check not measured.
#
# Control run on 2026-10-08, host cachy, through this row after
# hyprland-consent, on a source_tree copy of the shell whose
# ThemeLogic.APPEARANCE_RATIOS gives flyouts the full radius: "a flyout
# takes three quarters of it, 12 * 0.75" and "a menu entry follows its
# menu" failed, each reading 12.
# Control run on 2026-10-09, host cachy, through this row after
# hyprland-consent, on a source_tree copy of the shell whose shell.qml asks
# for no follow when the terminal font changes: the four checks that a
# terminal font "ends with a theme follow" failed, and no other check did.
# Control runs on 2026-10-09, host cachy, through this row after
# hyprland-consent, each on a source_tree copy of the shell with one rule
# of vgs.fonts's FontsLogic.js removed, and on each only the named check
# failed, reading listed: a terminal font that need not draw printable
# ASCII, "the terminal font's list leaves out fixed-width fonts that draw
# no text"; an interface list that keeps style names, "the interface font's
# list holds no style name"; and a terminal font that need not be
# fixed-width, its Fonts section printing every font's charset, "the
# terminal font's list holds fixed-width families alone".
#
# No latency is budgeted: each reading polls through expect_poll every
# 0.2 s for up to the harness's poll bound. The row leaves the user file,
# hyprland.lua, the plugins directory and every enablement as it found
# them.
