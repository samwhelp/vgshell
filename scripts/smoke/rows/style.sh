# The launcher's Style menu, which vgs.themes and vgs.bar contribute
# through their manifests' `menu` rows, and the two toggles behind it.
# The row opens the launcher on `style` and reads its rows through the
# probe; Theme and Wallpaper summon the theme browser on its two views; the
# gaps toggle writes `noWindowGaps`, the Hyprland layer's zero-gap
# workspace rule, which a tiled toplevel and `hyprctl workspacerules` read
# back with a user `general` gaps line after the loading line, across a
# theme apply; the bar toggle writes vgs.bar's `hidden`, which unmaps every
# bar and frees the space it reserved. Both toggles hold across a restart
# whose stop follows the second toggle's answer at once, and three tree
# copies are the controls of that restart: one whose bar host maps a hidden
# bar, one whose service gate waits on a hidden bar, and one whose write
# comes after its answer, which loses the edit at the stop.
# Disabling vgs.themes takes the Style category and the bar's row under it
# away. Each label the launcher draws follows its setting. A user menu file
# that relabels a plugin row is the control of the row list. It runs in the
# tail, since it restarts the shell, and leaves the launcher disabled,
# vgs.themes enabled only when it found it so, the gaps and the bar as they
# were and hyprland.lua as it found it.
