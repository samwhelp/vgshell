# Settings edits and the dispatch queue. The Settings window opens from a
# real click on the gear, so the compositor gives its window the keyboard,
# and a click on a text field gives that field keyboard focus. A write is
# published once: its own file notification is read and found identical.
# An unrelated change keeps an edit in progress: the same drawn field, its
# focus, its text and its cursor. The plug leaves the bar again at the
# end, as the harness started it. A plugin's page opens on Settings, and its tab strip shows
# Details and returns by the pointer and by the keyboard; a copy that opens
# on Details is the control. A plugin with something to set up has a Setup
# tab between them, which holds required steps and one Tools step.
# Optional actions stay beside Settings choices; facts stay in Details.
# The list marks required work with Setup needed; a row with the chip opens on Setup,
# and a page the manager opens by its id opens on Settings. A summonable plugin's page draws Open, which
# opens the plugin's window or panel through the manager. A mouse drag leaves a page where it was, while a wheel notch and
# Tab scroll it, and a two-finger swipe moves it as far as GTK moves a list. The
# Setup tab's Setup section draws the screen an offered step opens as that step, first
# and secondary, and a screen that lacks a command it needs disabled with a
# reason naming it. Dispatches asked for back to back run in order behind one
# process, the queue has a bound, and a process that cannot start does not
# stop the queue.
# A setting description's link opens its address through the desktop open
# route, by the pointer and by Return, into a stand-in that records it.
# A page reference in a description opens the page and tab it names; a
# Settings copy whose window opens no page for one is the control.
# A page reference in a setting's info dialog closes the dialog and opens
# the page and tab it names, and a summon that names a tab opens the page
# on that tab; a Settings copy that drops both is the control.
# The Bar's Open with select reads the browser profiles when it opens, and
# a calendar day opens in the profile chosen.
# The disabled Jarvis page's Home folder field, fed by the homes Jarvis
# publishes, offers only Custom… while Jarvis publishes none, and its Voice
# field, fed by the voices Jarvis publishes, draws nothing then. Its Voice
# provider field offers ElevenLabs in words.
# The window takes the shown page's height on each page or tab change at
# its top-left corner, and every listed plugin's Details ends inside it or
# shows the scroll area's bottom edge cue.
# The plugin list, the tallest page, maps with its frame inside the work
# area under the bar, which the box the room gave without the reserved
# area, the control, does not; the list fills that room, so the check
# judges a window the room bounds.
