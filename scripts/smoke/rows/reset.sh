# `vgshell reset` and its restore, end to end in the sandbox's own home.
# The row starts a copy of the sandbox's tree, tree-reset, since a reset
# restarts the shell from the tree it runs from and the shell after a reset
# runs the shipped plugin set: the copy's vgs.updates check is a stand-in
# that lists nothing, and devtools_stand_ins answers vgs.devtools, so that
# set reaches no host package manager and no network, as start-order.sh's
# default set does. It plants a user layer with a custom bar entry, the
# installed fixture acme.tick and a disabled vgs.launcher, and a custom
# theme file; welcome-seen is present, the consent row having answered the
# welcome. Every directory the reset acts on is checked to lie under the
# sandbox before the first ask.
#
# `vgshell reset` with no terminal and no --yes asks the running shell,
# which draws the reset question as the restart notice is drawn: Cancel,
# which holds the keyboard, Reset, and `vgshell reset --yes` behind Show
# command. Escape closes it and nothing moves: the control. The Settings
# window's Reset VGS button asks again; Reset, pressed only on the
# sandbox's own shell, brings a new shell over what a fresh install has:
# the backup holds the planted files, the shipped set runs with no user
# plugin and vgs.launcher enabled, the theme is the default, the welcome is
# unseen and the "VGS was reset" notice offers Restore previous settings,
# Keep these holding the keyboard, and no Show command.
# Hyprland lists no config error. Escape hides that notice and keeps its
# marker, so the shell `vgshell restart` brings next offers the restore
# again. Shift+Tab, typed on that keyboard as a person types it, moves
# the notice's focus from Keep these back to Restore previous settings.
# Restore previous settings, pressed while another theme command
# holds the theme lock, as the follow after that shell's first scan can,
# waits on that lock and brings another
# new shell over the planted files, the theme file byte for byte: the user
# layer is in effect, the welcome is seen, no notice shows and Hyprland
# lists no config error. The row then puts back the user file and theme
# file it found, removes the backups and starts the sandbox's own tree
# again. Every key goes through one virtual keyboard with the us layout,
# the harness's keyboard helper, that lives through every restart: a shell
# that had just started read a key wtype typed with the keymap of the
# keyboard before it, its Return as Escape, so Escape hid the notice in
# place of Restore previous settings, in 1 of 4 runs of this row on host
# cachy on 2026-10-06.
