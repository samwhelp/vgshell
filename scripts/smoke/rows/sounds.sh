# The core's sound service: a manifest's `sounds` events, capability
# `sounds`, which plays a plugin's own event through the one player,
# capability `soundSettings`, the one writer of shell.json `sounds`, and
# the Sounds section of the System window that sets each event's sound.
#
# The player is the pw-play stand-in of scripts/smoke/devices.sh, which
# records the file it was asked to play and plays nothing, so the row reads
# what would sound and no speaker does.
#
# Through the acme.sounds fixture the row reads the two capabilities'
# members and that the fixture holds them, the page's alone, the fixture's
# four events as the page lists them with the values each takes, and each
# answer of a play: an event plays its manifest default, one that is off by
# default answers `off` and starts no player, one the plugin sounds itself
# and an undeclared one are refused, and three plays of one event in one
# turn start one player. It writes a choice and reads it in the user file,
# in the fixture's own choices and in the next play; off silences the
# event; the manifest's default removes the choice from the file; a sound
# outside the core's set and an unknown plugin are refused and write
# nothing. Test plays a sound of the set and refuses another.
#
# The run limit: the row stands over the player with one that records its
# process and then sleeps, as a pw-play that PipeWire never answers. The
# play answers ok and the sound shows as playing; a second play in a later
# turn answers busy; then the service's own `runLimit` timer, 10 s of real
# time, must stop that process, log the unplayed sound and empty the
# playing list, and with the stand-in back the event plays again. This is
# a reading of the timer's wiring, which only elapsed time shows: it waits
# those 10 s inside expect_poll's bound and budgets no latency.
#
# The held event, `relay`, whose value the fixture holds: the page lists no
# value for it until the holder states one; a choice with no holder, a
# hold of an event the core stores, a second hold and a statement from an
# instance that holds nothing are refused; the page's choice reaches the
# holder, answers what the holder answers and writes no user file; the
# page lists the stated value and the holder's problem line; refresh, and
# opening the Sounds section, each have the holder read once.
#
# After hyprland-consent, which answers the first-start notice that would
# keep the keyboard from the section. In the Sounds section it reads the
# fixture's rows under its name, which sorts before every shipped plugin
# with a sound, so its Ping row is the first whatever else is enabled; the
# keyboard on that row's picker with no ring; Down choosing the next sound,
# which is saved and played while the picker keeps the keyboard; a click on
# that row's Test playing it again; Test shown on that row's line at
# Chime and hidden once the row is turned off; no Test for the plugin's own sound, whose picker offers Off and that sound alone;
# the held event's row with the stated value, the holder's line in the
# warning tone, and a picker that takes no choice while the value is
# unread.
#
# Control run on 2026-10-09, host cachy, through this row after
# hyprland-consent on a source_tree copy of the shell whose
# PluginLogic.soundRequest plays the chime for an event that is off: "an
# event that is off by default answers off" and "an event the user turned
# off answers off" failed, each reading ok, and "an off event starts no
# player" failed, reading one player more.
# Control run on 2026-10-09, host cachy, through this row on a source_tree

# limit stopped the player's process" failed, reading alive, and "the
# stopped run is logged as unplayed" failed, reading no line.
#
# No latency is budgeted: each reading polls through expect_poll every
# 0.2 s for up to the harness's poll bound. The row leaves the user file,
# the plugins directory and every enablement as it found them.
