# The leak check scripts/smoke/leaks.sh runs at every row's end, and its
# controls. Each control plants a row that leaves one class's state and
# runs it through smoke_row in a subshell whose failure count is its
# answer and whose lines go to their own file, as rows/updates.sh does for
# smoke_row's traceback rule. The check fails the planted row once, on a
# line that names the row, the class and the value; the control then
# undoes what the planted row left, so this row leaves nothing. The plants:
# - clients: a toplevel maps, unfocused under a window rule with
#   no_initial_focus;
# - focus: a click focuses that toplevel;
# - submap: a dispatch into a submap this row defines through
#   `hyprctl eval`, since Hyprland enters no submap it has not registered;
# - layers: a headless output, which gets a bar; and a vgs.themes
#   background, a state file naming a 5000x5000 image, which maps one on
#   every screen;
# - options: one live option set through `hyprctl eval`;
# - variables: shell_start_path assigned;
# - shell: shell_qs_pid pointed at a process holding the shell's
#   environment with a PATH that holds no stand-in, which breaks
#   devices_guard's path-shim rule;
# - shim: a file written into the shell's stand-in directory.
# A planted row whose header declares `# leaves: options` sets the same
# option, fails nothing and prints what it left; a header word that names
# no class fails its row once; a row after which the compositor answers
# nothing fails once for each class read through it, as unreadable.
# The crash check smoke_row runs before the leak check has its control
# here too: a crash signal to the shell leaves a Quickshell crash report
# and its reporter's window; the check names the report once with its
# stack trace, ends the reporter and starts a new shell with its own log,
# and a second check reads nothing. Quickshell's reporter can read an empty
# instance record (shell_crash_check's header), so the planted crash counts
# in either form, and the empty-record form has its own controls: a report
# planted at the path that form writes, beside a toplevel with Quickshell's
# default app id, reads as one crash named for the form and the check ends
# the toplevel; the same path written again reads as a crash again.
# smoke_row puts the pointer at rest before every row it runs outside
# another row: a planted row run so, with the pointer moved away first,
# reads the pointer at rest when it starts.
# A planted row whose shell is killed and which takes up no other, ending
# once the runner's next shell answers and maps its bars, fails once, on
# the shell class, and the failure carries the runner's exit line.
# The layers class is read once the per-screen layers are at rest. With
# each screen's background held in a FIFO until the end reading has read
# the layers or found them unsettled, a planted row whose shell the
# runner starts again after a SIGKILL, ending once the shell answers and
# maps its bars, fails nothing, and its end reading recorded the held
# background settling before it came to rest; its copy whose end reading
# does not wait for rest fails once, naming the background it missed.
# Before them the row restarts the shell with the background configured
# and prints, judging nothing, how long after start_shell returned the
# per-screen layers came to rest. The background's state file as it was
# comes back after, its layers go, and the row ends with a shell and a
# runner started anew.
# No latency budget. The toplevel's map is polled every 0.2 s for 5 s; the
# per-screen layers every 0.1 s for up to timeout_s; the end reading's
# files, for the feed, every 50 ms for up to timeout_s.
