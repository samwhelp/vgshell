# Not now records a marker for this Hyprland session. A restart in the same
# compositor session does not ask again, and a control copy that ignores
# the marker does ask. The consent row left the welcome-seen marker, so
# this later start with an unwired hyprland.lua asks the plain question:
# the welcome's second-start control.
#
# Then the welcome's own answers. With the marker removed, Escape on the
# welcome that asks declines and writes both markers; a copy whose decline
# marker write takes 2 s more shows the welcome, busy, while the decline
# runs, and the same copy with a judge that marks the welcome seen on the
# answer shows the plain question there, the reading's control. Once
# hyprland.lua is wired again, a start without the marker draws the welcome
# with Close alone, Escape closes it and writes the marker, and the next
# start, with the marker, draws nothing. The Close-alone welcome's theme
# line shows only while vgs.themes binds its shortcut, and earlier rows
# leave that plugin either way, so the row enables it for those starts. The
# row leaves hyprland.lua wired, the welcome seen, vgs.themes disabled only
# when it found it so and the real shell running.
