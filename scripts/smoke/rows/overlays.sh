# The overlay components, from a fixture bar widget holding a popover, a
# tooltip, a menu and a select, and a fixture panel with a select nested in
# a summoned surface, summoned too as an application window. Each overlay
# is a Qt window popup: it leaves the bar, takes keys through the nested
# seat, follows its anchor and closes on a press outside, on Escape and
# when its anchor hides; a select's list shows the hand over its entries.
# Popup rectangles are read through the popup's content item in the bar
# window's coordinates, the same coordinates a click takes, since the bar
# sits at the origin.
# The press outside closes each one through its focus grab: a copy of each
# without the grab, written beside the shipped file and built under the
# same widget, stays open through it. A press in the window the select sits
# in, which the grab hands to the shell, and Escape close its list, in an
# application window and in a bar flyout, through the DismissScope the
# three share: in the application window, a select copy whose scope takes
# the press without closing, and one whose scope drops Escape, stay open
# through the same press and key.
# A popover and a dialog in the summoned panel's popup cap their height at
# their share of the output; copies that find the output as the Qt window's
# own `screen` cap at the fallback.
