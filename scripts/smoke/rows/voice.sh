# Voice dictates through the core's `dictation` capability (D106), over the
# voxtype stand-in on the shell's PATH (scripts/smoke/fixtures/voxtype/):
# the daemon the core starts for it, its status follower and every record
# verb are the stand-in, whose daemon hears the words the row writes and
# types through the wtype stand-in beside it. The row's copy is a stub that
# answers the config and info verbs from the row's files; the bridge is a
# stub too. No row reaches the host's voxtype, its daemon, a microphone or
# the host's wtype. The row enables the plugin, reads the core's one daemon
# and follower, Voice's status and bar widget, sends its toggle and hold
# keys through the nested virtual-keyboard helper, reads setup offered
# while the stub model is missing and withheld when the stub reports it
# installed, then disables the plugin and reads its shortcuts, the core's
# daemon and its bridge child gone.
# The keys: the toggle key starts a `type` recording through the core, and
# the next press stops it, after which the wtype stand-in holds the
# stand-in's words; F9 held starts on the press and stops on the release.
# The key delivery uses physical code overrides for the row, so the helper
# reaches the same generated bind path that hold-shortcuts.sh exercises.
# The tap shortcut keeps its default keys: a lone Right Alt tap and a lone
# Right Ctrl tap each start a recording and the next tap stops it, and
# Right Alt used as AltGr with W starts none: the toggle key typed after
# it starts the one recording, where a chord that had started one would
# have had it stopped. Its control: with the tap unbound in the plugins
# row, a Right Alt tap before the toggle key reads the same.
# Another holder: while the fixture acme.dictation holds a `text`
# recording, Voice's widget reads idle and no display maps, and a Voice
# key, and the toggle the widget and the keys run, answer busy and leave
# that recording and Voice as they were. Two disposable copies of the
# service's logic, one that shows the phase whatever the holder and one
# whose toggle starts only while nobody records, each fail the reading
# they break.
# Enabling Voice without voxtype raises the requirement notice for voxtype
# itself, which the row closes with Not now after each enable.
# Without voxtype, the openTui IPC function, the launcher's route, raises
# the Voice requirement notice in place of Configure and opens no script,
# the notice drawing voxtype and its bridge under the one package of both;
# its control is a disposable manifest copy whose Configure requires
# nothing, which launches the script with no notice. The Plugins list
# marks Voice Setup needed, for voxtype and its bridge, with no warning
# icon, since no optional tool is missing. The Voice page states voxtype missing once, in the
# Requirements row on Setup: the tab draws no Setup section, no headline
# and no step, since Install all missing installs it, and Details draws
# Configure and Choose model, which are no setup screens and whose
# `requires` name voxtype, disabled, with a hint that says why; Details
# states no status of voxtype, missing or found. Once set up, the section
# reads Ready with voxtype's version and the model. Its control is a
# disposable manifest copy whose Configure requires nothing, which draws
# Configure active. Install all missing raises the
# notice for voxtype and its bridge, and its Install hands the terminal
# voxtype-bin through the AUR helper, the row puts the stubs back as the
# package step would, and the scan after the run closes the notice; Voice
# then has the core start its daemon, and the section offers Set up, which
# opens `core/dictation-setup`; its end with code 0 starts the daemon
# again, Voice reads the model the stub then reports, and the section
# reads Ready. Its control: the core's daemon ended by the row reads Set up
# needed with Set up first, and Set up's run brings Ready back. With a
# stand-in daemon the row starts, as a voxtype user unit runs one, Voice
# reads the daemon elsewhere and the section offers Stop the other voxtype,
# `vgs.voice/stop-other`; the row ends that daemon while the run is held,
# and the run's end with code 0 has the core start its own daemon in the
# same shell. Its control: a disposable VoiceLogic.js whose RESTART_TUIS
# leaves out stop-other keeps elsewhere once Voice reads the end and over
# three times the shipped restart's time, at least two seconds. A stand-in
# bin/vgshell-pkg answers detection with pacman and paru, whatever the
# host runs, for that part alone. It closes its client window and puts
# back the shell.json and the pointer position it found: its Settings
# clicks leave the pointer over the centre, where a later row's
# requirement notice would keep the keyboard.
# The on-screen display: Voice's own recording, held by the row, and the
# stand-in's held transcribing drive it, and the stub bridge prints the
# bridge's frames, and a disconnected line on request. The row reads the
# layer presented on the focused output only while recording or
# transcribing, under the plasma and ring settings, unmapped at idle and
# under `osd: off`; a key typed and a click under the orb reach the
# focused client; the bridge child is the stand-in, runs only while the
# display shows, starts again a second after it exits and goes with a
# disable while recording; the orb rests cool, warms while recording and
# starts again from rest on a disconnected line; at motion scale 0 the
# shown orb presents no frame for two seconds.
# Three disposable copies, an Osd.qml whose `shown` ignores the state, an
# Osd.qml with a full input mask and a Plasma.qml whose driver ignores the
# motion scale, each fail the assertion they break. Every window, output,
# setting, theme and copy the display part changes is put back; it reuses
# the Voice client above. States and frames poll once per IPC round trip;
# no latency budget is claimed. The install reading prints the presenter's
# end stamp, the core's record read, status writes, scan completion and IPC
# observer window in milliseconds. Date.now has millisecond resolution;
# endedAt precedes the presenter's atomic rename. Host load and CPU pressure
# cover the idle observer. The ceiling and poll interval are harness.sh's.
# Dictation sounds, the manifest's held sound event, whose value voxtype's
# config holds: the stub voxtype answers `config get` from a file under the
# sandbox and records each `config set`, the restart is the core's, read as
# a new start of the stand-in's daemon, and the config file the service
# looks at is under the sandbox home, so no host file is read or written.
# The row reads that Voice states voxtype's value to the Sounds section and
# that its first read, and a choice of the value already there, write and
# restart nothing; that Off chosen in the Sounds section with the pointer
# and the keyboard runs one `config set`, one restart and a read back; and
# each way a choice does not take effect, by its problem key: a symbolic
# link, which stays a link, no config file, a refused write, which restarts
# nothing, a restart the core refuses during a recording, a value voxtype
# did not keep, and a value that cannot be read. A value that is neither
# choice and a choice made without voxtype start nothing.
# Control run on 2026-10-09, host cachy, through this row on a source_tree
# copy of the service whose holder answers the page's choice without
# running it and whose choice does not ask for voxtype: "Off from the
# Sounds section reaches voxtype's config and its read back" failed,
# reading ["own",""], and "without voxtype a dictation sounds choice is
# refused" failed, reading ok.
# The bar widget: the row reads one start, the widget at recording and the
# display presented after the typed toggle key, then the same three after
# a pointer click on the widget, which opens no Configure; a second click
# stops the dictation. A right click opens the widget menu, which reads
# Hide, Voxtype Settings, Readme, Settings, and Voxtype Settings hands the terminal
# Configure.
# Without voxtype, a click on the widget starts no recording and offers
# voxtype and its bridge in the requirement notice; Not now closes it, and
# a click after it raises the notice again.
