# Voice uses a stub voxtype and a stub voxtype-audio-bridge on PATH, never
# the host commands. The row enables the plugin, reads its status and bar
# widget, sends its toggle and hold keys through the nested virtual-keyboard
# helper, reads setup offered while the stub model is missing and withheld
# when the stub reports it installed, then disables the plugin and checks its
# shortcuts, its status child and its bridge child are gone. Without
# voxtype, the openTui IPC function, the launcher's route, raises the
# Voice requirement notice in place of Configure and opens no script, the
# notice drawing voxtype and its bridge under the one package of both; its
# control is a disposable manifest copy whose Configure declares no
# `requires`, which launches the script with no notice. Set up on the
# Settings page raises the same notice in place of its script. The Voice
# page's Setup section reads Voice's setup state: without voxtype the
# missing requirement with its step first, once set up Ready with
# voxtype's version and the model and Set up again last. Without voxtype, Configure and Choose model, whose `requires`
# name it, draw disabled with a reason that names it, and every screen is
# active once it is found. Its controls are a disposable manifest copy whose
# setup entry is in no Setup group and offers no setup screen and whose
# Configure declares no `requires`, and a stopped service planted on the
# systemctl stand-in. Install hands the terminal voxtype-bin through the AUR helper,
# the row puts the stubs back as the package step would, and the scan after
# the run closes the notice and opens Set up on its own; the stubs then
# report the model and the service in place, a finished Set up sends one
# Voice notification, which vgs.notifications, enabled for that part,
# draws as a card, and the toggle shortcut runs a test dictation. Its control: Not now on that notice drops the Set up, so
# no setup TUI opens once a scan finds voxtype. A stand-in bin/vgshell-pkg
# answers detection with pacman and paru, whatever the host runs, for
# that part alone. The key delivery
# uses physical code overrides for the row, so the helper reaches the same
# generated bind path that hold-shortcuts.sh exercises. The tap shortcut
# keeps its default keys: a lone Right Alt tap and a lone Right Ctrl tap
# each run one record toggle, and Right Alt used as AltGr with W runs none,
# read against an F9 hold typed after it. Its control: with the tap
# unbound in the plugins row, the same Right Alt tap runs none. The device
# stand-in systemctl answers the service probe from a planted reply. It
# closes its client window and puts back the shell.json and the pointer
# position it found: its Settings clicks leave the pointer over the centre,
# where a later row's requirement notice would keep the keyboard.
# The on-screen display: the stub status stream follows a file the row
# appends states to, and the stub bridge prints the bridge's frames, and a
# disconnected line on request. The row reads the layer presented on the
# focused output only while recording or transcribing, under the plasma and
# ring settings, unmapped at idle, at stopped and under `osd: off`; a key
# typed and a click under the orb reach the focused client; the bridge
# child is the stand-in, runs only while the display shows, starts again a
# second after it exits and goes with a disable while recording; a status
# follower that exits unmaps the display and starts again; the orb rests
# cool, warms while recording and starts again from rest on a disconnected
# line; at motion scale 0 the shown orb presents no frame for two seconds.
# Three disposable copies, an Osd.qml whose `shown` ignores the state, an
# Osd.qml with a full input mask and a Plasma.qml whose driver ignores the
# motion scale, each fail the assertion they break. Every window, output,
# setting, theme and copy the display part changes is put back; it reuses
# the Voice client above. States and frames poll once per IPC round trip;
# no latency budget is claimed. The install reading prints the presenter's
# end stamp, the core's record read, status writes, scan completion and IPC
# observer window in milliseconds. Date.now has millisecond resolution;
# endedAt precedes the presenter's atomic rename. Host load and CPU pressure
# cover the idle observer. The ceiling and poll interval are harness.sh's.
# Dictation sounds, the manifest's held sound event, whose value voxtype's
# config holds: the stub voxtype answers `config get` from a file under the
# sandbox and records each `config set`, the device stand-in systemctl
# records the restart, and the config file the service looks at is under
# the sandbox home, so no host file is read or written and no service
# restarts. The row reads that Voice states voxtype's value to the Sounds
# section and that its first read, and a choice of the value already
# there, write and restart nothing; that Off chosen in the Sounds section
# with the pointer and the keyboard runs one `config set`, one restart and
# a read back; and each way a choice does not take effect, by its problem
# key: a symbolic link, which stays a link, no config file, a refused
# write, which restarts nothing, a failed restart, a value voxtype did not
# keep, and a value that cannot be read. A value that is neither choice
# and a choice made without voxtype start nothing.
# Control run on 2026-10-09, host cachy, through this row on a source_tree
# copy of the service whose holder answers the page's choice without
# running it and whose choice does not ask for voxtype: "Off from the
# Sounds section reaches voxtype's config and its read back" failed,
# reading ["own",""], and "without voxtype a dictation sounds choice is
# refused" failed, reading ok.
# The bar widget: the stub's record toggle moves the status stream, as
# voxtype's daemon does, while the row asks. The row reads one record
# toggle, the widget at recording and the display presented after the typed
# toggle key, then the same three after a pointer click on the widget,
# which opens no Configure; a second click stops the dictation. A right
# click opens the widget menu, which reads Hide, Voxtype Settings,
# Settings, and Voxtype Settings hands the terminal Configure.
# Control run on 2026-10-10, host cachy, through this row on a source_tree
# copy of the widget whose click runs configure() and which hands the menu
# no entry: "a click on the Voice widget runs one record toggle, as the
# toggle key does" failed, reading no record line, with the terminal handed
# Configure, and "the menu holds Hide, then Voxtype Settings, then
# Settings" failed, reading ["Hide","Settings"].
# Without voxtype, a click on the widget starts no record and raises the
# notice Set up's press raises, holding Set up to open after the install;
# Not now drops the Set up, and a click after it raises the notice again.
# Control run on 2026-10-10, host cachy, through this row on a source_tree
# copy of the widget whose click only offers the notice for voxtype: "the
