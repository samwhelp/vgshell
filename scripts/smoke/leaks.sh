# Sourced by harness.sh: the leak check smoke_row runs over every row. The
# state a row hands to the rows after it must equal the state it found, in
# each class below, or a scoped run that holds the row and the full run on
# main read different states and one of them fails (VGS-877). A row that
# leaves a class on purpose declares it in its own leading comment block,
# `# leaves: CLASS [CLASS...]`; the check skips that class for that row and
# prints what the row left. The check reports only: it closes, restores and
# resets nothing.
#
# The classes, one reading each:
# - clients: the mapped client windows, `hyprctl -j clients`, as address,
#   class and title;
# - focus: the active window, active_window's [class, title];
# - submap: key_submap;
# - layers: the mapped layer surfaces, `hyprctl -j layers` with a pid, one
#   namespace each, read once the per-screen layers are at rest
#   (leak_layers_rest);
# - options: every Hyprland option `hyprctl -j descriptions` lists, with
#   its live value from `hyprctl -j getoption`;
# - variables: leak_start_variables, each by `declare -p`;
# - shell: devices_guard's reading of the running shell, shell_qs_pid,
#   `no-shell` with no pid and `environ=unreadable` for a dead shell;
# - shim: the executable files of the shell's stand-in directory, $shim,
#   by name and content hash; the record files a stand-in writes there are
#   no command a shell runs.
#
# Each row is read at its start and at its end, so a harness step between
# two rows, such as qml-smoke.sh turning the compositor's logs on after
# hyprland-consent, belongs to no row. A row run inside another row, as
# rows/jarvis-keys.sh runs one and rows/updates.sh and rows/leak-check.sh
# run planted rows in subshells, is judged against its own start, and the
# outer row keeps its own. rows/leak-check.sh holds the controls.

# The start variables: what start_shell starts every shell with, shell_env
# and shell_start_words, and the PATH shell_resolves reads,
# shell_start_path, all defined in harness.sh.

# leak_layers_rest DIR: waits for the per-screen layers to be at rest: the

# host's namespace on its screen exactly when the host's window is
# visible. A background maps only once its state file is read and its
# image decoded, both asynchronous, which can end after start_shell
# returns, so a reading taken before then misses a layer a later reading
# sees. It reads every 100 ms for up to timeout_s and writes the
# milliseconds it waited to DIR/layers.rest-ms, and the first state not at
# rest it read, if any, to DIR/layers.first-unsettled. With no shell, a
# shell whose probe has no perScreenLayers, or a compositor that does not
# answer, it returns at once and the layers are read as they stand; a
# probe that fails otherwise, or answers no list, does the same and
# leaves its reason in DIR/layers.unprobed. At the bound, or on a reading
# it cannot judge, it writes the last state to DIR/layers.unsettled and
