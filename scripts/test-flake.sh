#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds flake.nix in a nix container and checks the package it ships.
#
# The suite stages the working tree's tracked and untracked files, the way a
# `github:` flake reference sees a commit, and mounts the copy read-only. The
# nix store lives in the podman or docker volume named in `volume` below, so
# later runs reuse the downloads; `podman volume rm` on that name frees it.
#
# Rows, each a keyed `ok` or `FAIL` line:
#   - `nix flake check` passes with the committed flake.lock unchanged.
#   - `nix build` succeeds. The build runs scripts/check-install-tree.sh on the
#     installed tree, so it ships the tree every other channel ships.
#   - The installed Keyboard service reads its nonempty Nix-store catalog.
#   - `nix run .# -- --version` prints `vgshell <VERSION>`.
#   - For the file $out/bin/vgshell resolves to and for bin/vgshell-tui, the PATH
#     row: the one `# vgs-nix-path` line, run in an empty environment,
#     resolves the mapped required commands in the core and all shipped
#     manifests that are installed with VGS and `qs`, but
#     not `hyprctl`, since the session supplies Hyprland; a second run
#     leaves PATH unchanged.
#   - The same two files are their source with only that line added, right
#     after the leading comment block the usage text is read from.
# Controls:
#   - A required command installed on request, left in the expected list, must
#     fail the PATH row on that command.
#   - Removing the Keyboard catalog substitution must fail its installed reader.
#   - flake.nix with the requirements rows cut from the runtime PATH must fail
#     the PATH row on every requirement.
#   - the closure without qrencode must fail the PATH row for
#     the saved-network sharing command.
#   - bin/vgshell-tui from the build with its PATH line removed must fail the
#     PATH row.
#   - flake.nix whose insertion loop reaches only bin/vgshell must fail the
#     build with vgshell-tui's `nix-path=missing` line.
#   - packaging/install-tree.manifest with a planted entry must fail the build
#     with that entry's `install-tree=missing` line.
#
# Exit 0 when every row and control hold, 1 otherwise. Exit 77 names what
# could not run: no podman or docker, the image cannot be pulled, or the
# container cannot reach cache.nixos.org.
