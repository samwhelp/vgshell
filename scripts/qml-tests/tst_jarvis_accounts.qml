// The account reader's model and effort writes, over a stand-in of the
// core's write path. That path is synchronous to its end, as
// Config.writeUser, the Config.effective binding and Plugins.refreshRow
// are: a write sets `user`, the `effective` binding derives the settings,
// and its change handler replaces `shell` before the write returns. A write
// made from the change handler of a binding that reads `shell` updates that
// binding inside its own update: Qt logs a binding loop and keeps the old
// value, and the runner fails a file on any warning. The Process stand-in
// runs nothing: a test ends the list read by hand.
