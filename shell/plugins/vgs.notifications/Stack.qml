// The stack on one screen, the content the service hands its layer: the
// toasts, at the edge the service's `position` names inside the space other
// layers do not reserve, so never over the bar, with the newest toast
// nearest that edge, and the act shortcut's caption-only refusal toast,
// while the service holds one, nearer still. The layer host builds one per
// screen and assigns `screen`. Presses reach only the toast cards. It
// keeps no keyboard. The host destroys a copy a moment after the service
// that declared it can already be gone, so every binding on the service
// checks it for null, and the look is the stack's own reading of the same
// table.
