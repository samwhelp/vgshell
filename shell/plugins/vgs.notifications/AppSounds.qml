// An app's own notification sound, muted while the shell plays none of its
// own: the service creates this while Do Not Disturb is on or Sound is off
// and destroys it when both turn back or the service goes.
//
// Two layers. The sound rule (wireplumber/vgs-notification-sounds.lua),
// while WirePlumber runs it (`ruleRunning`), holds every new output stream
// the hold names silent before it links it, so the chime's first sample is
// silent however late the shell reacts; this writes that hold, naming the
// apps of every notification the service keeps or arms, and the rule
// keeps it only while this instance's writer lives. The shell then frees
// a stream the rule held for an app no notification armed, such as a
// call, as soon as WirePlumber links it. Every other stream keeps the
// reaction: `arm` names the app of a notification that arrived, and a
// stream of that app that then starts to play is muted until it pauses
// (NotificationLogic.appSoundStep).
//
// The mute is the stream's softMute: WirePlumber 0.5 keeps a stream's
// `mute` and volumes for every later stream of the same app
// (state-stream.lua, keyed by media.role, else application.name), so a
// plain mute of Slack's chime would mute its next call, and it keeps no
// softMute. Any write of the stream's `mute` mixes the stream at its own
// volume and mute again, though its softMute still reads true; a write
// of `softMute: false` alone, or with the mute in the same write, leaves
// it mixed at full volume whatever its own volume. So the lift is two
// writes: softMute false, then the mute the stream already has, which
// leaves both reading false at its own level (measured on a private
// PipeWire 1.6.9 and WirePlumber 0.5.18 with stand-in streams, VGS-1311,
// and with a stream at channel volume 0.5, VGS-1424). A volume written to
// a held stream lifts its softMute the same way, so it is muted again.
// The destruction lifts every stream this instance wrote to. A shell
// stopped by a signal runs no destruction, but its writer dies with it,
// so the rule lifts what it held; the next instance's first scan lifts
// what the reaction left, and a shell that does not start again leaves
// that stream muted until its app closes it.
