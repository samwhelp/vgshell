# Displays

Displays sets each screen's mode, scale, orientation and brightness. Apple Pro Display XDR and Apple Studio Display brightness works over USB, other external displays over DDC, and a laptop's built-in display over its backlight.

![System Settings → Displays: one row per display with its brightness, and the screen each display shows on](../../../docs/images/plugins/vgs.displays-pane.webp)

## Features

- A brightness item in each bar. It controls the display on its own screen: scroll to change the brightness, click to open the flyout. It hides while no display it can control lights that screen.
- A flyout with one slider per display, the bar's own display first, Link displays, and Display Settings.
- The brightness keys change the display you work on, or every display. An on-screen display shows the new level.
- System Settings → Displays: a display arrangement canvas, each screen's resolution, refresh rate, scale, orientation, colour mode, colour depth, HDR levels and brightness, the screen a display shows on when VGS cannot tell, Identify, Link displays, Dimming, and the access each kind of display needs.
- A display mode change first opens a trial. Keep saves it, and Revert or the timer restores the old mode.
- Identify shows each screen's name and flashes the display, so you can tell two displays of one model apart.
- The displays dim after a time without input, to a level you choose. Any input brings each display back to its level. A playing video keeps the displays from dimming.
- When a display needs your permission, Allow opens a terminal that shows the one-time setup and asks for your password.
