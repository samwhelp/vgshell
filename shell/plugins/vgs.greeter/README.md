# Login screen

`vgs.greeter` logs you in on a screen that uses your VGS theme and background. It is for a computer that starts VGS at boot.

## Features

- Shows the time, your accounts and a password field on every screen, in your theme over your background.
- Lists every installed session: Hyprland, Hyprland (uwsm-managed), GNOME, Plasma and any other Wayland or X11 session.
- Chooses Hyprland (uwsm-managed) on the first login, then remembers your last account and each account's last session.
- Unlocks your login keyring with your password, so apps that use the keyring start signed in.
- Types with the system keyboard layout. A layout without Latin letters gets US English first, and Left Alt + Right Alt switches between them.
- Accepts a fingerprint or another method your login configuration sets: press Enter with the password field empty.
- Offers Suspend, Restart and Shut down.
- Copies your theme and background for the login screen each time you change them.

## Setup

The plugin ships with VGS. The login screen is off until you turn it on: open Plugins, choose Login screen and press Set up. A terminal shows each file the setup writes and asks for your password once. The login screen shows at the next boot.

Setup needs greetd and VGS installed from a package. If another login screen, such as GDM or SDDM, is turned on, Set up is not offered and VGS leaves that login screen alone. On that login screen, Hyprland (uwsm-managed) starts the same session.

Removing the setup puts back the login configuration that was there before.

The Settings page shows whether the login screen is set up and whether its copy of your theme is up to date.
