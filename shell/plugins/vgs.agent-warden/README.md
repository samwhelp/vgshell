# Agent Warden

Agent Warden shows whether your AI coding agents stay within their memory and process limits. It is for people who run several agents on one computer. [vsys](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vsys) provides the warden it reads.

## Features

- A shield in the bar. Its colour and icon follow the agents' state, with the number of running agents or problems beside it.
- A panel under the shield: one sentence on the state, the most serious items first, and the agent group's memory against its limit.
- Open vsys in the panel opens the vsys dashboard in a floating terminal.
- A desktop notification when an agent gets near a limit, when agents wait for memory, when a move fails, when leftover work is cleaned up, and when the warden stops checking.
- `SUPER+CTRL+Y` opens and closes the panel. The Keys row on the plugin's Settings page changes it.

## How it works

The plugin reads the warden's `status.json` and publishes the agent state for VGS to show. It observes limits and never enforces them. The warden runs as a systemd user timer, so its checks and corrections continue when VGS restarts or stops.

## Setup

The plugin's Settings page and its panel show each setup step as an action, only while the step is needed. Install vsys opens the install screen for vsys. Set up opens a floating terminal that starts the Agent Warden checks. Once Agent Warden runs, the page shows no setup action.

| Setting | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| Show count | Shows the number of running agents or problems beside the shield. |
| Hide when idle | Hides the shield when no agents run and no problems need attention. |
| Notifications | Alerts for problems, all events or none. Everything also tells you of each move back into limits. |
