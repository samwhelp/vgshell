# shellcheck shell=bash
# tui/pipeline.sh: the Updates pipeline, sourced by tui/update.sh, which
# runs every source, and tui/update-source.sh, which runs one. Both hold one
# lock and one log and run the same steps in the same order; a source the
# run leaves out is skipped where its step would stand. bin/vgshell-tui runs
# both from a private copy of the plugin's snapshot, so bin/facts is beside
# this file's directory, and the VGS tree is the one VGS_TUI_LIB lies in.
# The order:
#
#   1. the log, script(1) into $XDG_STATE_HOME/vgshell/updates/update.log, then
#      the lock vgs-tui-updates; the run writes a file of its own that
#      becomes update.log once it holds the lock, so a second run refused
#      busy never truncates the log of the run it found
#   2. a warning when / has less than 10 GiB free
#   3. the plan box, then one question unless -y
#   4. the review of third-party packages, when the `reviewThirdParty`
#      setting is on, an agent resolves (UpdatesLogic.reviewPlan through
#      bin/facts review) and the AUR or a pacman repository that is not
#      official has an update pending: the run fetches the AUR build files
#      itself and judges each one's install script by its change against
#      the installed one (UpdatesLogic.installScriptChange through bin/facts
#      install), and the agent runs in a second window, the `review` TUI,
#      which the service opens from the stable review start directory. The
#      per-run directory is inside it, so the agent's folder trust is
#      keyed on one path and the user trusts it once. The run waits for
#      the verdict and asks once per flagged package, Skip or Install
#      anyway, so a package the user skips reaches its upgrade step as
#      `--ignore <name>`. The review runs before any credential is cached:
#      shell/plugins/vgs.updates/pipeline.md § Third-party review
#   5. one sudo session, when the package layer's elevation command is
#      sudo and a snapshot or the system step needs root. That command is
#      the one `vgshell pkg plan upgrade <primary>` names, from shell.json's
#      `packages.elevate`, else the first of sudo, doas and run0 on PATH;
#      doas and run0 ask as their own rules say, as bin/lib/pkg-run.sh does
#   6. a snapshot through snapper or timeshift behind that command, before
#      any step that replaces a package: the system's, the AUR's or the
#      vgshell-git rebuild. None is taken when the plugin's `snapshot` setting
#      is off, when neither tool is on PATH or when no elevation command
#      resolves, and the plan box says which; a failed snapshot warns and
#      the update goes on
#   7. VGS itself: `vgshell self update` for a checkout or a curl install
#   8. the system: `vgshell pkg run upgrade --manager <primary>`, which joins
#      the session
#   9. Flatpak and mise: `vgshell pkg run upgrade --manager flatpak|mise`
#  10. each plugin, then each theme, behind its upstream:
#      `vgshell plugin|theme update <id>`, which shows its diff and asks
#      [y/N]; `--yes` only when the `trustPluginUpdates` setting is on
#  11. the end of the sudo session, which drops the credential
#  12. the AUR, last, so no PKGBUILD runs under the update's credential:
#      the `aurCommand` setting's words, else `vgshell pkg run upgrade
#      --manager aur`, then `<helper> -S vgshell-git` when VGS is that package
#      and behind, since an AUR helper rebuilds a -git package only when
#      its recipe's version changes. The helper asks sudo itself, so the
#      phase runs under tui.sh's sudo guard: the credential it caches is
#      dropped when the phase ends, fails or is interrupted
#  13. pacman's orphaned packages, removed only on a yes, default no, after
#      a system or AUR upgrade
#  14. a shell restart when a package step or the rebuild replaced the VGS
#      package
#  15. a check request to refresh the widget and window
#  16. a reboot question when the run changed a package, by pacman -Q
#      before the first package step and after the last, that the CachyOS
#      reboot hook names under its script's conditions
#      (UpdatesLogic.rebootPackages through bin/facts reboot), or the
#      kernel or the running Hyprland was replaced (tui.sh's
#      vgs_tui_reboot_check)
#  17. the result list, then the failure count and failed parts: the last
#      output names each failed part, its cause and its next step
#
# The package steps are the package-manager table's own plans, read with
# `vgshell pkg plan` and run with `vgshell pkg run`: they take no -y, so each
# manager asks its own questions in this terminal. -y answers only the
# pipeline's own start question; the orphan and reboot questions are then
# reported instead of asked, and the review's questions are still asked.
# A source step (7 to 10 and 12) that fails records its cause, the last
# line it printed on stderr, and the run goes on with the next; a run with
# a failed step exits 1 after the reboot question. After a failed or
# declined system step the AUR step and the vgshell-git rebuild are
# skipped, since they build against the system that step left. A step a
# Ctrl-C ended ends the run with 130. Any other failing step ends the run:
# the ERR trap prints `updates: failed exit=<n> log=<file>` and how to
# recover, and the session's or the guard's EXIT trap drops the credential.
#
# Every refusal prints `updates: refused: <key>=<value>` first. A bad
# invocation exits 2; a held lock exits 75.

# The ERR trap needs errtrace, so the file sets the mode its steps rely on
# whichever entry script sources it.
