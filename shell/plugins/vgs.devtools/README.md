# Dev Tools

Dev Tools installs, updates, pins and removes developer tools: coding agents, apps, command-line tools, languages, editors, databases and terminals. Its Catalog page also shows the VGS version and the tools VGS is missing.

## Features

- A Catalog page with search, Installed, Updates and Not installed filters, and one row per tool.
- Install, Update, Remove, Version, Pin, Unpin and Roll back actions. Each change runs in a floating terminal.
- Update all updates unpinned tools only.
- A Dev Tools launcher category lists catalog rows and installs a missing tool before it starts it.
- A tool that something outside VGS provides shows Managed outside VGS and still starts from `PATH`.
- mise manages the tools. While it is missing, Install all missing on the Setup tab installs it.
