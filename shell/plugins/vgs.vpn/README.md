# VPN

VPN shows your saved VPN profiles and your Tailscale connection. It turns it on and off, chooses an exit node, switches accounts and signs in. It has a bar icon with a flyout, and a VPN section in System Settings.

## Setup

The VPN section and the plugin's Settings page offer one step at a time. Enable and Allow run in a setup window that shows its commands and asks before it runs them. While Tailscale is not installed, Install all missing on the Setup tab installs it.

| Step | When | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | The Tailscale service is off | Starts the service and keeps it on after a restart. |
| Allow | Your account cannot change Tailscale | Makes your account the Tailscale operator, so changes need no administrator password. |

Check every sets how often VGS reads Tailscale while the flyout and the section are closed: 10, 30 or 60 seconds.
