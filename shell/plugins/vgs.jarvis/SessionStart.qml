// The user's Jarvis session as the Jarvis package's session command owns it
// (backend/session-control.js). This instance's build, at shell start or
// when the user enables Jarvis, makes the one automatic call: the package
// starts the session after the app's Off or, while Start Jarvis at boot is
// on, for a boot it has not handled, and answers the session as it is for
// any other. The Start and Retry actions ask for a start, a changed account
// or home replaces a session that lives, and each opening of the Jarvis
// page reads the session again. A read starts nothing. turnedOff() is the
// user's Off: it stops the session in a process that outlives this service.
// Each answer is the Jarvis session row.
