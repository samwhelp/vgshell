"""Local speech sidecar: wake word, speech to text and text to speech for the daemon.

LocalSpeech.js starts it as the selected runtime's interpreter, inside a
private network namespace, as `python -I local-speech.py --state DIR --data DIR
--parent PID`. It holds setup's lock shared, so setup cannot replace the runtime
under it, and loads only after setup's readiness judge answers ready.

Wire, both directions: frames of a u32be header length, a u32be payload length,
a UTF-8 JSON object header and the payload bytes. Audio is float32 little-endian
mono. Ids are positive integers; each new request takes a larger id.
  in:  {type:"listen", id, detect}; {type:"wake", id}; {type:"check", id}; {type:"audio", id} + 16 kHz samples;
       {type:"end", id}; {type:"abort", id};
       {type:"speak", id, speaker} + one sentence's UTF-8 text
  out: {type:"ready"} once; {type:"partial", id, text, rev}; {type:"final", id, text};
       {type:"woke", id}; {type:"checked", id, result}; {type:"audio", id} + samples;
       {type:"spoken", id, rate}; {type:"failed", id?, cause}
A speaker is the name of one of the voice artifact's `speakers`, whose index
is the model's sid; a name the loaded voice lacks answers failed speaker-unknown.
A wake request spots the keyword in its audio and answers woke once; it has no
end, only abort. A check uses that same detector until end, then answers ready,
silent (only zero or no samples), or not-heard. One input request is open at a time.
A failed frame without an id ends the sidecar. A message for an utterance the
sidecar already answered crossed that answer and is dropped. Stdin EOF exits 0;
the runtime not ready exits 77; a protocol violation exits 65; other failures 1.
