# Scratchpads

Scratchpads shows and hides an app with one key, over whatever you work on. Each pad holds one app at the size, place and screen you set in Plugins.

![The Scratchpads page in Plugins](../../../docs/images/plugins/vgs.scratchpads-page.webp)

## Features

- Add, change and remove pads on the Scratchpads page in Plugins. No file to edit.
- Give each pad its own key under Keys.
- A press starts the app when it is not running, then shows it once its window is open. An empty pad never shows.
- Set the size as a share of the screen, so one setting fits a laptop panel and a large display.
- Put the pad in the centre, at an edge or in a corner, with a margin.
- Choose the side it comes in from, and whether it slides, fades or appears at once.
- Open it on the focused screen or on one screen you choose.
- Start its app at login, so the first press shows it at once.
- Click anywhere beside the pad, or move to another window, to hide it.
- Remove a pad, or turn off Scratchpads, and its app comes to the workspace you are on.

## Settings

| Setting | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| App | The command that starts the app. Terminal, Second terminal and Third terminal open your default terminal, each with its own window class. Custom takes any command. |
| Window class | The app-id of the window the pad holds. The app must open its window with this class. Each pad needs its own. |
| Width, Height | The pad's size, in percent of the screen's free area. |
| Position | Where the pad sits: the centre, an edge or a corner. |
| Margin | The space between the pad and the screen edge it sits at, in percent of the shorter side of the screen's free area. |
| Comes in from | The side the pad slides in from and back out to. |
| Motion | Slide, fade or none. |
| Screen | The screen the pad opens on: the focused one, or one by name. |
| Start at login | Starts the app when VGS starts, hidden. |

A new pad has no key. Set one in the Keys section of the same page.

A new pad takes the Terminal choice and its window class. For a second terminal pad, pick Second terminal and its class. While two pads share a window class, the later one opens nothing, and its key shows a message that says so. An app that opens its window with another class than the pad names is never shown. After 15 seconds a message says so.
