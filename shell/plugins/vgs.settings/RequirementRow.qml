// One read-only Requirements row of a plugin's page, drawn from one entry
// of its manager row's `requirements` (PluginLogic.requirementRows): the
// requirement beside its state from the last scan as a Badge of one word,
// the entry's `badge` (PluginLogic.requirementBadge, the rule the
// requirement notice draws its chips with too): Present, Missing, Optional
// for a missing optional requirement, since the purpose under it says what
// the tool adds, or Outdated for a command below the version the plugin
// needs, optional or not, since an installed tool the plugin calls fails
// below that version. Details lists the automatic alternatives with it, by
// the requirement's title, its command or its D-Bus label; the row draws
// no step of its own.
