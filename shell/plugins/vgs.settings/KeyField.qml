import QtQuick
import qs.Ui

// One row of a plugin's Keys section, one per shortcut: the bind row of
// qs.Ui, which draws every alternative key of the shortcut in one field and
// sends a pressed or typed key and a removal, with the manifest's keys
// under it, or none for a pad's key, and buttons of its own, shown only
// where they change something. The add button edits a new alternative and
// listens for it. The reset button, shown while the keys in effect are
// not the manifest's, sends undefined, which removes the shell.json entry
// so the manifest's key or list of keys applies. While a user Hyprland
// bind holds one of the keys, the conflict line under the field names the
// file and line that bind sits on, as a link that opens that line in the
// user's editor, and three buttons under that line resolve it in one
// click: Remove my line asks the page to confirm, then the key capture
// takes that line out of the user's file and reloads Hyprland, so the
// plugin's bind keeps the key; Pick another key starts a capture for that
// key; Use my binding removes that key from the shortcut, unbinding it
// when it was the only one, so the user's own bind keeps the key. After a
// removal the line under the field says which line went, and Undo puts it
// back. The field then shows what the configuration holds again. The
// removal's undo record lives in the key capture until the undo; a field
// destroyed before it, such as by closing Plugins, releases the record, and
// a removal that answers after the field is gone releases its own.
//
// A key typed as text waits in the text entry until it is saved: `edited`
// says the entry holds a key other than the one in effect, `save()` sends
// it as Enter there does and `discard()` drops it. The page tells the row
// through `settle(key, accepted)` whether the manager accepted the value
// it sent, and a refused key returns to the text entry of the alternative
// edited, so it stays an unsaved edit the user corrects: the key an edit
// of the field set, or a one-key value a caller sent itself, such as the
// page's key IPC. A refused removal, and a list a caller sent, open no
// entry, since no one key was asked for. `edits` is the
// page's set of unsaved edits (EditSet), which the row joins while edited
// and tells of each typed key the manager accepted; a pressed key is no
// edit, so the set hears of none.
