// One Status row of a plugin's page, drawn from one entry of its manager
// row's `status` (PluginLogic.statusRows) as StatusLines: the entry's label
// beside its value and the entry's hint; the words of the hint the entry's
// `link` names open that address through `openLink`, and a page reference
// in a hint (LinkText) asks for its page through `openPage`. The row draws no
// action of its entry: an entry that declares one is a step of the Setup
// tab (Steps.declaresStep). A presence
// or a state draws as a Badge in the tone the entry carries, a state's
// further lines each as a Badge of that tone under it, and its hint, the
// state's sentence where the state carries one, wrapped under them; a
// text, a count or a time as one line of text, a time through Timestamp;
// an entry the plugin has not published, or published while disabled, as
// "Not reported". A presence
// list draws its label and hint alone, "None detected" while the list is
// empty, then one line per item: the item's label beside a Badge of its
// presence, its hint, and, for an item that is a secret's presence, Add key
// in the chip's place while nothing is stored, or Replace and Remove after
// the chip (Steps.itemView). Each line is one group of the row's GroupList,
// divided from the next as the rows of a section are. No row takes an edit
// of a value: a key's step goes to the manager through `panel` (D061).
