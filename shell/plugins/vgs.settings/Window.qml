// The Plugins window: every plugin the manager lists, and one page per
// plugin, drawn from its manager row alone. The window host builds it as a
// Hyprland window titled Plugins, which Hyprland floats, centres, frames
// and focuses like any other window. It asks to be `size.window.width`
// wide, or the screen's room's width when that is less, and as tall as the
// page it shows, the list or a plugin page's shown tab, up to
// `size.window.tallHeightShare` of the monitor's height, or the room's
// height when that is less; the room is the screen's work area under the
// bar less `size.window.gutter` a side (OverlayState.room), read from the
// screen its `screens` capability gives. The window host maps it at the
// larger of that and the page's full height, up to the screen's room;
// once it shows, each change of the shown page, the list, another
// plugin's page or the other tab, resizes it by the same rule through its
// `compositor` capability, keeping its width. A change inside a page, such
// as a rescan's rows, keeps the size.
// The pages fill whatever size the window has, and a page taller than it
// scrolls, with the scroll area's edge cue. The list page and the plugin page
// sit side by side and slide on `motion.duration.normal`, so a
// `motion.scale` of 0 makes a push or a pop instant; the page not shown is
// hidden once the slide ends, so the keyboard reaches the shown page alone.
// Escape pops a page; on the list it is left to the window host, which
// closes the window. Enabling, disabling, showing a widget in the bar, a
// setting and a key go through the manager capability; the rows come back
// from the core, so the window shows what the configuration holds. Adding,
// updating and removing a plugin open the manager's core TUIs, a floating
// terminal where each question stays a question, a plugin's setup button
// opens its own TUI, and Install shows the core's requirement notice; the
// window stays open behind them, and its rows change once the command
// there ends. Each open asks the manager for
// a scan, so a command installed or a setup run from a terminal while the
// shell ran reads as it now is: each scan raises the requirements revision
// a plugin's service re-reads its own state on.
//
// The payload is a JSON object: `{}` opens the list, `{"plugin":"<id>"}`
// that plugin's page, and an id no plugin has opens the list with a notice
// naming it. Any other key, or a payload that is no object, throws out of
// open(), which refuses the summon. A plugin that leaves the manager's rows
// while its page is shown, as a removal's rescan does, returns the window
// to the list with a notice naming it.
//
// A plugin page that holds an unsaved edit is left only after a prompt:
// the back button, Escape, the title's menu, a deep link to another page,
// the Details tab and a hide by the shell each ask once, Save, Discard or
// Cancel, over a scrim. Save writes every edit and leaves when each was
// accepted, Discard drops them and leaves, and Cancel, Escape and a press
// on the scrim stay. A request that comes while the prompt shows replaces
// the one it waits on, so no second prompt opens. The window host asks
// `holdsHide()` before it hides the window, and the window hides itself
// through its `surfaces` capability once the prompt is answered. A close
// through Hyprland asks nothing: the window is gone, and its edits with it.
//
// Remove my line on a Keys row asks first, over a scrim: the confirmation
// says which line of which file goes, that Hyprland reloads and that Undo
// puts it back. Remove line runs it; Cancel, Escape and a press on the
// scrim keep the line. Either answer returns the keyboard to the row.
