"""Service.qml consumes JSON lines for action progress and completion.

An error's optional reason language-data-unavailable selects its notice title.

While an area is selected, and until a screenshot's file is written, one
`cancel` line or stdin EOF ends the capture with no file and emits cancelled.
A selection with a request emits selection-ended for focus restoration.
Countdown ticks report remaining seconds; countdown-hidden confirms its UI was
removed. Until the recorder writes its file, `cancel` or stdin EOF ends it with
no file; then one `stop` line or stdin EOF sends SIGINT to the owned recorder.
A recording emits stopped once the recorder ends, so the service can start the
next capture while this worker post-processes, then saved.
saved carries `actions`, its notification's buttons: one `{id, label, argv}`
for each program that opens the file and is installed; `default` opens it.
probe emits the offered audio sources and cameras and the missing languages.
SIGTERM releases all owned children, including during service replacement.
