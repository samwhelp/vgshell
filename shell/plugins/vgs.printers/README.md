# Printers

Printers adds, chooses and removes your printers. It has a Printers section in the System Settings window, under Hardware.

Screenshot made with `scripts/readme-shots.sh` in the nested sandbox, with the default theme at scale 2, over the sandbox's printing stand-ins.

## Features

- The list of your printers, with each printer's state, its queued jobs and the default printer marked.
- While the section is open, the list changes when the printing service reports a change, such as a new job or a printer that stops. When the section is closed, Printers runs nothing in the background.
- Set as default makes a printer the one your apps print to first.
- Remove takes a printer off the computer. Delete removes the selected printer.
- Find printers lists the printers on this computer and your network. Add sets up a printer that needs no driver.
- A printer that needs a driver opens Print Settings, where you choose its driver.
- The address field adds a network printer by its name or IP address, such as `printer.local`.
- Print Settings opens the full printer settings for drivers, paper size, two-sided printing and quality.
- Each change asks your permission in the system's password prompt. VGS never sees the password. A change you do not allow changes nothing.
- Turn on printing starts the printing service in a setup window when it is off.

## Requirements

Printers reads your printers with the printing service's own tools, which come with CUPS. Without CUPS the section says that printing is not installed, and Install printing installs it in one press. The printer helper is optional: without it the list works, and each change button offers to install it. Print Settings is optional too.

The list reads `LC_ALL=C lpstat -r -p -o -v`, and the default printer is the scheduler's own, read with `ipptool` and `ipp/default.test` over cupsd's domain socket, `ipp://%2Frun%2Fcups%2Fcups.sock/`. While the section is open, the watcher, `bin/printers-watch`, makes one CUPS subscription with the `dbus://` recipient through `ipptool` and listens for `org.cups.cupsd.Notifier` signals with `dbus-monitor --system`. It renews the subscription at half its lease and cancels it when it exits, which it does when the section closes. Each change is one `gdbus call --system` to `org.opensuse.CupsPkHelper.Mechanism` (cups-pk-helper): `PrinterAdd` with the `everywhere` model, then `PrinterSetEnabled` and `PrinterSetAcceptJobs`, or `PrinterSetDefault`, `PrinterDelete` and `DevicesGet`. polkit asks through your session's agent. Turn on printing runs the core system step `service-cups`, `systemctl enable --now cups.service`, in the setup window. It is offered only while neither `cups.service` nor `cups.socket` is active.
