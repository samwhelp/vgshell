// The unlock mark of a locked toggle, internal to the module: a lock-open
// IconButton `stack.inline` after the toggle's body, built only while the
// toggle is locked (DisabledReason) and its `unlock` is set. `unlock` is
// `{ label, run }`, the words of the one step the user takes to unlock the
// toggle and the function that takes it, the shape of a setup step's
// action; another value is logged and draws no mark. The mark names the
// step, a click on it, or Space or Enter, calls `run`, and it is the Tab
// stop after the toggle. With the keyboard on it, the mark shows the
// toggle's reason; under the pointer the toggle's own reason shows, since
// the mark lies inside the toggle and a second tooltip would repeat it.
// `room` is the width the toggle keeps after its body for the mark, 0
// without it. When the lock clears with the keyboard on the mark, as a
// step that unlocks at once does, the focus goes back to the toggle with
// the reason the mark held, before the mark goes: Qt would otherwise move
// it to the enclosing focus scope (QQuickItem::setParentItem clears the
// focus of an item it unparents). A step that opens another window leaves
// the mark its scope's `focus` with no `activeFocus`: the toggle then takes
// the mark's place in that scope and takes the keyboard from no one, so
// the keyboard is on the toggle when the user comes back. Qt hands a
// window that comes back the ActiveWindowFocusReason, so no control shows
// a ring then until the next key moves the focus (a qml-unit run,
// 2026-10-13). The mark is a toggle's own part, so an IconButton, which
// extends Button, holds none: Button cannot contain its own kind.
