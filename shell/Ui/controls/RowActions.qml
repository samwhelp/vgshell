// The actions of one key/value row side by side, such as a plugin's Update
// and Remove: RowAction children `rowAction.gap` apart, top-aligned on one
// line as tall as the tallest. A hidden action takes no room, and nor does
// a child without a size, such as the Repeater that makes the actions.
// Every row that sets two or more actions beside each other composes it,
// so the gap is one rule. With no width set it is as wide as its actions
// and stands on one line. Given less width, the actions continue on a new
// line once the next one would pass that width; each line then takes
// `row.height` with its actions centred in it, so the lines stand as far
// apart as the rows of a page do and the first sits where a one-line row's
// action does. `firstLineHeight` is that first line's height while the
// actions wrap and 0 while they stand on one line; FormRow reads it to set
// its label beside the first line. `inkAbove()` and `inkBelow()` are how
// far inside its top and bottom edges the highest and the lowest action
// are drawn.
