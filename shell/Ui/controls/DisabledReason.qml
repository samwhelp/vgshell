// The locked state of a control, internal to the module: an enabled
// control whose `disabledReason` is set. Qt gives a disabled item no
// active focus and Tab skips it, so a control a reason disables stays
// Qt-enabled and this takes its actions away instead: a shield over the
// control takes every press while locked, so a click toggles, opens or
// clicks nothing, and `takeKey` takes Space, Return and Enter, the keys
// the control hands it first. `KeyNavLogic.activate` refuses a locked
// control too, since a `Keys.onReturnPressed` handler runs before
// `Keys.onPressed` and stops it (a qml-unit run, 2026-10-13). The control
// draws no hover or press while locked. Its drawn parts fade while the
// control itself stays opaque, so an unlock mark it holds (UnlockMark)
// draws at full strength: a part that holds the control's FocusRing draws
// its fill and border through `faded`, the colour at the disabled
// opacity, so the ring on it keeps its full strength, and a part with no
// ring binds `fade`, the disabled opacity. The reason shows in the shared
// Tooltip on hover and on keyboard focus of the control, built only while
// locked, and is the control's accessible description. A control the
// plain Qt `enabled` disables is not locked: it keeps its own fade and
// shows no reason.
