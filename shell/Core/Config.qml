// Shell configuration: the shipped defaults under config/ merged with the
// user's file. Both files are watched; a change re-derives `effective`
// once. Each file's state is one tagged value. A file that does not parse
// or fails PluginLogic.configError keeps the last good value and logs the
// error, so a typo never blanks the desktop; a user file in that state
// blocks writes until it passes again, so a manager edit never overwrites
// unread edits. Nothing is built before `ready`: the shipped file has
// loaded once and the user file has settled, so a bar never draws from the
// user file alone. Each file is a WatchedFile, so an edit that lands during
// a read is read again. An edit of the user file is on the disk before its
// write answers. A user file of the previous format version is rewritten as
// this one when it is read (PluginLogic.migrateConfig), through the same
// judge, and written once; one the judge refuses is never overwritten.
