// Shell configuration: the shipped defaults under config/ merged with the
// user's file. Both files are watched; a change re-derives `effective`
// once. Each file's state is one tagged value. `effective` and `notReady`
// are assigned by publish() alone; a read or a write commits `shipped`,
// `user`, the file's text and state first, visible at once, so a write
// made from a handler of either builds on them, and its own change is told
// after the one in flight.
// A file that does not parse or fails ConfigLogic.configError keeps the
// last good value and logs the error, so a typo never blanks the desktop;
// a user file in that state
// blocks writes until it passes again, so a manager edit never overwrites
// unread edits. Nothing is built before `ready`: the shipped file has
// loaded once and the user file has settled, so a bar never draws from the
// user file alone. Each file is a WatchedFile, so an edit that lands during
// a read is read again. An edit of the user file is on the disk before its
// write answers. A user file of the previous format version is rewritten as
// this one when it is read (ConfigLogic.migrateConfig), through the same
// judge, and written once; one the judge refuses is never overwritten.
