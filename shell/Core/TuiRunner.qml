// `bin/vgshell-tui launch` per accepted request and at most one
// `bin/vgshell-tui check` probe. TuiRecords owns the record listing, reaper and
// one `bin/vgshell-tui wait` process per live run. PluginLogic decides which
// TUI a request names, whether its plugin is enabled, the arguments, whether
// the key is busy or the launcher state refuses it, the launcher's argv, how
// each exit moves the state, what the records say, which waits run and what
// each `done` receives. The launcher forks the terminal into a session of its
// own and exits once the presenter wrote its record, so a terminal outlives
// the shell that opened it. Each run's `done` belongs to the lifetime of the
// instance that asked: a destroyed instance's callback is dropped and its
// run still ends. The core's own request, through openCore, holds its `done`
// for the shell's life.
