// The core notice state: requirement notices for missing and outdated commands, the
// restart notice for a shell whose own files changed under it, the reset
// question and the "VGS was reset" notice that offers the restore, and one
// consent slot for core-owned setup that must not run silently, which
// draws the first-start welcome around the Hyprland question.
// Requirement notices decide which plugins' missing commands the user is
// shown, in what order, on which screen, and the install the shown notice
// runs (docs/architecture/commands-are-data.md § Consent). Six triggers
// raise a notice: the pluginInstalled IPC function `vgshell plugin add` calls, Plugins.setEnabled
// turning a plugin on, a plugin's own `requirements` capability, the
// `manager` capability's installRequirements and its act on a status
// action that installs, and the `doctor` capability asking for the core's
// or an enabled plugin's commands. A notice belongs
// to one owner, a plugin or the core, whose requirements and missing
// commands Registry holds.
// PluginLogic decides what each trigger asks for, whether it joins the
// queue, and what the shown notice lists and installs; NoticeHost draws
// it. The managers come from `bin/vgshell-pkg detect --json`, with
// `--holders` for commands that have a floor, run when the first notice
// arrives and after each install. Install opens the core TUI
// `core/requirements-install`, and Update, for commands below their floor,
// `core/requirements-update`, which also installs the same manager's missing
// packages; once its run ends, one rescan follows, and
// a notice whose required commands that scan and its version read find, at
// their floor, is closed, while one the run left as it was says so. A notice a
// plugin's setup TUI raised in place of itself (TuiRunner.runFor) opens
// that TUI once it closes so, so one press of Set up ends set up (D061).
// The core never elevates: the package manager asks in the terminal (D034).
