# VG Shell (VGS)

A desktop shell for Hyprland, built on Quickshell. It draws the bar, panels and windows on each screen, and every part of it is a plugin you can turn on or off.

![VGS: the bar and the theme browser on the desktop](docs/images/plugins/vgs.themes-browser.webp)

## Features

- A Plugins window on SUPER+M holds every plugin's settings, shortcuts and on/off switch.
- System Settings on SUPER+PERIOD holds Sound, Displays, Bluetooth, Network, VPN, Mouse and Keyboard.
- Ships the [plugins](#plugins) listed below.
- Themes change the colours, wallpaper and window borders in one click.
- Updates installs system, VGS, plugin and theme updates, and an AI agent can review third-party packages before they install.
- Plugins do not depend on each other: turn one off and the others keep running.

## Install

Arch Linux:

```bash
paru -S vgshell-git
```

On Arch, the curl install and checkout need an installed AUR helper: paru or yay.

Fedora 44:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable vanillagreen/vgshell
sudo dnf install vgshell
```

Any distribution:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanillagreencom/vgshell/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --git
```

Nix:

```bash
nix run github:vanillagreencom/vgshell -- start
```

From a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vgshell
vgshell/bin/vgshell start
```

More install options: [docs/architecture/distribution.md](docs/architecture/distribution.md).

## How it works

VGS starts with Hyprland and draws the bar, panels and windows on each screen. Each of those is a plugin you can turn on, turn off, add or remove. A theme sets the colours every plugin uses.

## Setup

The Arch and Fedora packages start VGS after install. They start it at login in a uwsm session, and in any session once Connect in the welcome wires `hyprland.lua`. For a curl, Nix or checkout install, add this line to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`:

```lua
hl.on("hyprland.start", function () hl.exec_cmd("vgshell start") end)
```

## Writing a plugin

Read [docs/architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md). An agent loads the `vgs-plugin` skill, which scaffolds a plugin from templates and checks it.

## Licence

VGS is under the MIT licence: [LICENSE](LICENSE). Bundled fonts, icons and other third-party files are listed in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
