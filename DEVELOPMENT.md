# VGS development

Quickshell 0.3.1, Hyprland with Lua configuration, node 18 and python3; `vgshell run` checks the floor before it starts, and `scripts/check-packaging.js` holds the recipes to it.

## Run

```sh
bin/vgshell run                              # the shell from this checkout, in a Hyprland session that runs no other VGS
scripts/qml-smoke.sh --rows bar,launcher     # the shell inside the nested sandbox, running the named rows, the core rows and the rows those read
scripts/sandbox-shots.sh gallery settings    # PNGs of named scenes from the sandbox, under tmp/
```

Never start a second shell against the live session, and never kill Quickshell processes by name. Anything that starts a compositor, the shell, `qmltestrunner` or a browser goes through `scripts/smoke/gpu-fence.sh`, as `scripts/qml-smoke.sh` does.

## Test

```sh
scripts/validate                             # the checks the changes since the last pass reach
scripts/validate --list                      # the same selection, printed and not run
scripts/validate --changed <commit>          # a fix round: the checks the changes since that commit reach
scripts/validate unit --full                 # one whole area; unit needs Qt and no Wayland session
scripts/validate package                     # the Arch recipes in a rootless podman container
```

Exit 77 means a check could not run and is not a pass. The `qml` area is the nested sandbox and needs `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; `scripts/qml-smoke.sh` runs it alone. A new check is a row in `scripts/validate` with its must-fail control beside it.

A run that must outlive a tool call starts detached with HUP, INT and QUIT at their defaults and records its own pid: `setsid env --default-signal=HUP,INT,QUIT bash -c 'echo $$ >tmp/run.pid; exec scripts/validate offline' </dev/null >tmp/run.log 2>&1 &`. Under `nohup` or a bare `&` those signals start ignored, and the signal rows of `scripts/test-gpu-fence.sh` and `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` fail. Wait with `tail --pid=PID -f /dev/null` on the recorded pid, never on `$!`, which `setsid` can leave at once, and never on a `pgrep -f` hit, which can match the caller's own shell.

Keep temporary scripts under `tmp/`: an untracked file under `scripts/` is an unmapped input and selects the full area. A copy of `scripts/sandbox-shots.sh` under `tmp/` pins its `repo=` line to the checkout, since the script finds the checkout from its own path.

Two GitHub workflows run on `main`, never on a push or a pull request. `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` runs `scripts/validate --full` on a schedule while the repository variable `NIGHTLY` is `on`, and reports only. `.github/workflows/kendex-refresh.yml` takes kendex package updates on each kendex release, every 6 hours and by hand: it opens the `kendex/refresh` pull request, which merges at once because `main` has no merge requirements. Kendex owns that file's bytes; it changes only through kendex's `refresh/adopt-refresh.sh`, which refuses a hand edit.

## Debug

```sh
bin/vgshell log                              # the running shell's log, through qs log
scripts/qml-smoke.sh --keep --rows <row>     # keep the sandbox after the row; the shell's log is under its runtime dir
scripts/sample-shell-memory.sh               # sample the live shell's memory until interrupted, read-only
```

Quickshell links jemalloc, so glibc's `MALLOC_PERTURB_` does nothing. Start a shell with `MALLOC_CONF=junk:free`, as the smoke harness does, to make a use-after-free crash at its reader, and symbolize the crash with `gdb -iex 'set debuginfod enabled on'`.

## Smoke rows and shots

- Run a row through `scripts/validate qml --changed <base>` or name it to `scripts/qml-smoke.sh --rows`. Both add the core rows `bar`, `hyprland-consent`, `session`, `start-order` and `auth-sentinel`, and the rows the input lines of the rows in the run name: without `hyprland-consent` the first-start notice keeps the keyboard, and without `bar` the device fakes never start and `share-picker` waits on `pw-dump` with no bound.
- Rows run in one bash shell. Give a new row's helpers a prefix no other row uses.
- Enabling `vgs.jarvis` raises the requirement notice, which takes the keyboard, because the sandbox hides `tesseract`. A Jarvis row that reads focus or pixels calls `jarvis_setup_requirements` from `scripts/smoke/rows/jarvis.sh` before it enables the plugin.
- `diagnostics` reads the log of the last shell a row started, and `jarvis-input` and `hyprland` restart the shell before it in a full run. A warning an earlier row logs can fail a scoped run and never a full one; compare the instance-log paths the rows print.
- A scripted edit of a row or of `scripts/smoke/harness.sh` goes in a file run with `python3 FILE`. An inline here-document ends at the row's own `PY` line, and bash runs the rest as commands.
- Never edit a script while a run is reading it: bash reads a script as it runs.
- Name the before tree of `sandbox-shots.sh --rev` by the change's parent, `<change>^`. `origin/main` becomes the after tree once the change lands.
- Two runs of one tree differ in a few dozen glyph-edge pixels. A pixel-for-pixel proof reports a same-tree run's count beside the base-to-HEAD count: `magick A B -compose difference -composite -colorspace gray -threshold 0 -format '%[fx:round(mean*w*h)]' info:`.
- A grim capture can trail a probe reading by a frame or two. Take a motion frame from its own pixels, or the last frame after a settled reading that equals the frame before it.
- The fixture `acme.probe` draws an empty 10 px widget. Shoot a real plugin's widget.
- `bin/vgshell-system` reads the device fakes' tree in the sandbox, so a system step that probes a host file finds it absent. The scene plants that file under `$devices_system_root` before it enables the plugin.
- The stand-in terminal starts no terminal. A floating TUI shot starts `kitty` with the presenter's argv in its scene, one theme per run, and copies in only the `gum` target: the `kitty` target's reload signals every kitty the user runs.

## Jarvis self-test

`scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh` runs one real Jarvis turn in the nested sandbox, with a real AI model and the local or the realtime voice, and writes one JSON record. Its header holds the options, the record and the exit codes; [validation.md § Jarvis self-test](docs/architecture/validation.md#jarvis-self-test) holds its rules. `scripts/validate` never runs it.

```sh
# Once: a local voice setup under a scratch HOME, made by the plugin's own setup. The small tier holds the voice --tts speaks with.
env -u XDG_STATE_HOME -u XDG_DATA_HOME HOME="$PWD/tmp/jarvis-local" python3 -I shell/plugins/vgs.jarvis/setup-local install small
export JARVIS_LOCAL_MODELS="$PWD/tmp/jarvis-local/.local/share/vgshell/jarvis/local/models"
export JARVIS_LOCAL_PYTHON="$PWD/tmp/jarvis-local/.local/share/vgshell/jarvis/local/venv/bin/python"

node shell/plugins/vgs.jarvis/backend/accounts.js --tree "$PWD" sign-in-folders claude 120   # each Claude Code sign-in folder, then its id
scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh --wav shell/plugins/vgs.jarvis/fixtures/probe.wav --brain <id>   # a recorded voice
scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh --tts "What time is it?" --brain <id>                            # a sentence the pinned voice speaks
scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh --type "What time is it?" --brain <id>                           # a typed line
scripts/jarvis-selftest.sh --suite volume --brain <id>                                       # one acceptance case
```

- The record goes under `tmp/selftest-records/` unless `--out` names a file. The last line of the run is `selftest=<key>`, and exit 77 means the run could not run.
- The sandbox's shell finds the brain's program on the caller's `PATH` and runs it under the sandbox's HOME. A launcher that needs the caller's HOME, such as a version manager's shim, fails there: put the directory of the program itself first on `PATH`.
- The run needs what `scripts/qml-smoke.sh` needs, and `pipewire`, `wireplumber` and `python-dbusmock` for the device fakes.
- A brain that is a saved key, and `--voice realtime`, read that key from your keyring through a filtered bus, which needs `xdg-dbus-proxy`. A locked keyring or a key that is not stored ends the run with exit 77; the run never asks you to unlock.

## Regenerate

```sh
node scripts/check-readme.js --write-plugins   # README § Plugins, after a plugin is added, removed or renamed
scripts/readme-shots.sh                        # every plugin README image, after its row is added to docs/images/plugins/shots.tsv
packaging/install-system.sh                    # into a scratch DESTDIR and PREFIX, then:
scripts/check-install-tree.sh --write DESTDIR PREFIX   # packaging/install-tree.manifest, after a shipped file is added
scripts/measure-shader.sh --calibrate scripts/shader/ceilings.json --runs 3   # the shader ceilings
```

## Containers

```sh
scripts/arch-packages.sh                     # build and install both Arch recipes
scripts/fedora-container.sh --image fedora:44   # install the Fedora package from its source RPM
scripts/test-flake.sh                        # build the flake in the nix container
scripts/readme-install.sh                    # every README install command, against what users get from main
```

Each needs podman and the network, and exits 77 when it cannot run. Run `scripts/readme-install.sh` by hand before a release.

## Write a plugin

Read `docs/architecture/overview.md`, then load the `vgs-plugin` skill, which scaffolds a plugin from its templates and checks it. A plugin lands with its row under `scripts/smoke/rows/` in the same change.

## Release

The maintainer cuts every release from their own machine, with their own gpg key, GitHub login and AUR SSH key. VGS has no CI workflow for releases or package publication: [D040](docs/decisions/D040-one-shared-install-tree.md). The package recipes live beside the source under `packaging/`, so one checkout both tags the release and publishes the recipes that build it. Two scripts do the work. Their headers, which `--help` prints, state every refusal, output line and exit status.

- `scripts/release X.Y.Z` makes the GitHub release `vX.Y.Z` from the pushed tag: the source archive `vgshell-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`, `install.sh`, `SHA256SUMS` and its detached signature `SHA256SUMS.asc`, written to `dist/`.
- `scripts/publish-aur.sh vgshell vgshell-git` pushes the recipes under `packaging/arch/` to the AUR. It holds `vgshell` back until the release asset's sha256 is the one the recipe pins.

Both take `--dry-run`, which makes every check and changes nothing outside `dist/`. `scripts/test-release.sh` and `scripts/test-publish-aur.sh` prove them with stub `gh`, `gpg` and `ssh`, in the `cli` area of `scripts/validate`.

At each landing on `main` that changes `packaging/arch/vgshell-git/`, the overseer publishes `vgshell-git` to the AUR through `scripts/publish-aur.sh` on the maintainer's machine. The landing notice names the AUR commit or the refusal. A refusal leaves the publication acceptance box open.

### Before the first release

- Set `release_key` in `install.sh` to the full upper-case fingerprint of the release signing key, the `fpr` value `gpg --list-keys --with-colons` prints. The release signs `SHA256SUMS` with that key, and the curl installer verifies the signature against the same value. `scripts/release` refuses while it is empty.
- Log in with `gh auth login`, as an account that may create releases in `vanillagreencom/vgshell`.
- Register an RSA SSH public key with the AUR account that maintains `vgshell` and `vgshell-git`. The publisher reads the private key from `AUR_SSH_KEY_FILE` and nothing under `~/.ssh`. It pins the AUR's host keys in `packaging/aur-known-hosts`.

### Versions

- `VERSION` holds the release's SemVer version, and the tag is `v` followed by it: [distribution.md § Version](docs/architecture/distribution.md#version).
- While VGS is at 0.x, a minor bump marks a breaking change to `shell.json`, the plugin API, the manifest or the theme package format. A patch bump marks fixes only.
- Plugin manifest versions change independently of `VERSION`.
- The archive name carries no architecture.

### Flow

1. Prepare the version. `scripts/check-packaging.js` refuses a recipe whose version differs from `VERSION`, so every file below moves to `X.Y.Z` in the same commit:
   - `VERSION`: the one line `X.Y.Z`.
   - `packaging/arch/vgshell/PKGBUILD`: `pkgver=X.Y.Z`, `pkgrel=1` and `sha256sums=('SKIP')`. The sum stays `SKIP` until the archive exists; a sum left from the previous release passes the check but makes `scripts/publish-aur.sh` hold `vgshell` back.
   - `packaging/arch/vgshell/.SRCINFO`: regenerated from that PKGBUILD, which the check compares byte for byte.
   - `packaging/fedora/vgshell.spec`: `Version: X.Y.Z`, `Release: 1%{?dist}`, and a new first `%changelog` entry whose header line ends in `- X.Y.Z-1`.
   - The version's changelog entry.

   ```bash
   printf '%s\n' X.Y.Z >VERSION
   # packaging/arch/vgshell/PKGBUILD: pkgver=X.Y.Z, pkgrel=1, sha256sums=('SKIP')
   (cd packaging/arch/vgshell && makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO)
   # packaging/fedora/vgshell.spec: Version, Release and the new %changelog entry
   node scripts/check-packaging.js
   ```

2. Run `scripts/validate --full` once. A release is an explicit full sweep. Then commit on `main` and push.
3. Tag and push the tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "VGS X.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. Make the release. The last lines name the archive's sha256.

   ```bash
   scripts/release --dry-run X.Y.Z
   scripts/release X.Y.Z
   ```

5. Pin that sha256 in the `vgshell` recipe, check it and push it. `scripts/check-packaging.js` refuses `SKIP` once the tag exists.

   ```bash
   # packaging/arch/vgshell/PKGBUILD: sha256sums=('<the release: sha256 value>')
   (cd packaging/arch/vgshell && makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO)
   node scripts/check-packaging.js
   git commit -am "packaging: pin the vgshell X.Y.Z tarball" && git push origin main
   ```

6. Publish both recipes. Exit 75 means a package was held back; its `deferred` line names the reason.

   ```bash
   scripts/publish-aur.sh --dry-run vgshell vgshell-git
   AUR_SSH_KEY_FILE=<the AUR account's private key> scripts/publish-aur.sh vgshell vgshell-git
   ```

7. Rebuild the Fedora package: set `vgshell.spec`'s `Version`, `Release` and `%changelog` with `VERSION`, then run `copr-cli edit-package-scm vgshell --name vgshell --commit vX.Y.Z` and `copr-cli build-package vgshell --name vgshell`. The GitHub webhook rebuilds `vgshell-git` on every push to `main`: [§ Fedora](#fedora).
8. Verify every channel, as below.

### Fedora

The COPR project `vanillagreen/vgshell` holds two packages, `vgshell` from a release tag and `vgshell-git` from `main`, and depends on the two third-party COPRs that ship Quickshell and Hyprland. These commands, run with a COPR API token, set up the project and its packages, and recreate them:

```bash
copr-cli create vgshell --chroot fedora-44-x86_64 --chroot fedora-44-aarch64 \
  --repo copr://errornointernet/quickshell --repo copr://sdegler/hyprland \
  --runtime-repo-dependency copr://errornointernet/quickshell \
  --runtime-repo-dependency copr://sdegler/hyprland
copr-cli add-package-scm vgshell --name vgshell-git --clone-url https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vgshell.git \
  --commit main --spec packaging/fedora/vgshell-git.spec --method make_srpm --webhook-rebuild on
copr-cli add-package-scm vgshell --name vgshell --clone-url https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vgshell.git \
  --commit v0.1.0 --spec packaging/fedora/vgshell.spec --method make_srpm
copr-cli build-package vgshell --name vgshell
copr-cli build-package vgshell --name vgshell-git
```

Add the repository's GitHub webhook for `vgshell-git` only after the `v0.1.0` tag exists: `packaging/fedora/srpm.sh` builds `vgshell-git` without a release tag, so a webhook added earlier publishes a pre-tag build whose version sorts above the first builds after the tag, and a user who installed it gets no update. A user installs with `sudo dnf copr enable vanillagreen/vgshell`, then `sudo dnf install vgshell`. Once the first build installs in a clean container from the published project, the README gains a Fedora install command.

### Verification

Each check reads the published channel, never the checkout.

```bash
# The release's assets and their signature.
gh release download vX.Y.Z --repo vanillagreencom/vgshell --dir /tmp/vgshell-X.Y.Z
(cd /tmp/vgshell-X.Y.Z && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS && gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS)

# The AUR's view of both packages.
curl -fsS 'https://aur.archlinux.org/rpc/v5/info?arg[]=vgshell&arg[]=vgshell-git'

# Each AUR package, installed through paru in a clean Arch container, as a
# user does: paru also builds the depends only the AUR holds.
for pkg in vgshell vgshell-git; do
  podman run --rm docker.io/library/archlinux:latest bash -euc '
    pacman -Syu --noconfirm --needed base-devel git sudo
    useradd -m builder
    echo "builder ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >/etc/sudoers.d/builder
    runuser -u builder -- bash -c "cd && git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git && cd paru && makepkg -si --noconfirm"
    runuser -u builder -- bash -c "cd && paru -S --noconfirm --skipreview $1"
    vgshell --version' _ "$pkg"
done

# The README's published installs, including curl in its prepared Arch image.
scripts/readme-install.sh

# The flake at the tag.
podman run --rm -e NIX_CONFIG='experimental-features = nix-command flakes' docker.io/nixos/nix:2.35.2 \
  nix run github:vanillagreencom/vgshell/vX.Y.Z -- --version
```

Packaged installs print `vgshell X.Y.Z`; checkout installs report `X.Y.Z` in `version --json` and print that report's `describe` value when present. Then run `vgshell run` from each install inside the nested sandbox: [validation.md](docs/architecture/validation.md#nested-sandbox).
